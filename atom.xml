    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535655259/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3835/14535655259_8660ab6035_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Montezuma sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>So after I was finished in Uvita I headed to the next place along the coast of
Costa Rica that seems to get rave reviews, Montezuma. Montezuma is described by
guidebooks and Lonely Planet tourists as some beautiful and undiscovered hippy
beach town, so I went there expecting maybe something like Byron Bay was 10-15
years ago.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I was sorely let down, and I feel all those people need a strong reality check.
The place is horribly overrun by tourists. It felt like the last real local had
left years ago and now there is nothing but pot smoking gringos, pretending
they&#8217;re in some hippy paradise. Or maybe that is hippy paradise, and I&#8217;m just
jaded. Having grown up close to both Byron Bay (when it was far less developed
than it is today) and Nimbin (where at least there are pot smoking locals too),
I felt Montezuma brought nothing of interest to the table.</p>

<p>I had a huge amount of trouble finding a decent room. Most places I tried were
full up, with the remaining places either being empty and super creepy, or
without lockers. Not cool at all with the reputation this place has specifically
for thieves breaking into hostel rooms. Eventually I found a place with room for
me but it was a complete dive.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535853397/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3870/14535853397_2cb0f86dc2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Montezuma" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma</em></a></span></p>

<p>I tried to switch hostels to one of the highly rated places the next day to see
if my opinion on the place would change, but they were full up again so I reserved a
bed for the following day after that.</p>

<p>I really tried to give the town a good chance, but even after moving hostels to
the fully booked one, no one was ever around. For a town that was full up in
terms of accommodation, it was strangely like a ghost town during the day. It
seemed like everyone staying in Montezuma disappeared off to snorkelling tours
or surfing lessons in other towns&#8230; Why exactly do people come here again?</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t all shit though.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719920754/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Cliff diving by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2920/14719920754_8811d76f8a_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Cliff diving" class="img-responsive"><em>Cliff diving</em></a></span></p>

<p>I decided to go see the waterfall, and that turned out to be really worthwhile.
The walk to the falls was pretty easy, a lot of rock hopping over the steam
leading away from the falls. The bottom fall was very beautiful, with lots of
people swimming in the pool at the bottom or sunning themselves on the
surrounding rocks. It looked like it would be very dangerous to jump off, but
that didn&#8217;t stop some folk.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535670980/in/set-72157645450071209" title="This was part of the path to the top by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2937/14535670980_401cf4fdec_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="This was part of the path to the top" class="img-responsive"><em>This was part of the path to the top</em></a></span></p>

<p>I climbed up to the top of the second fall via the alternate path. There were
some extremely steep parts where you only really had a rope to hold on to to
climb up and down, almost like abseiling. The path went up quite a bit higher
than the falls, around the side and then came back down to the top of the falls.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719940384/in/set-72157645450071209" title="A local jumping down the second falls by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3841/14719940384_922db43cea_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="A local jumping down the second falls" class="img-responsive"><em>A local jumping down the second falls</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were lots of people up there, some Ticos were jumping down the second
waterfall into the pool below it. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s 15M, and it looks like a fairly
safe jump straight down. I heard some long screams before they finally hit the
water. However, being a solo traveller with no one there to look out for me I wasn&#8217;t
willing to jump myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719914944/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma waterfall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3905/14719914944_1052cf80c1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Montezuma waterfall" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma waterfall</em></a></span></p>

<p>I climbed back down to the bottom falls, and went for a swim there. It was cool
that you could get right against the rocks, behind the water curtain and hear
the falls pounding down in front of you.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719948464/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Mc Mary's by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3890/14719948464_cd40d3e8a7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Mc Mary's" class="img-responsive"><em>Mc Mary&#8217;s</em></a></span></p>

<p>On my last night there, while wandering around the streets waiting to see the
fire show that happens on Thursday nights, I met a friendly American couple who
waiting for reggae night in one of the bars to start and spend the night talking
with them. It just so happened they were driving to Santa Teresa the next day
and so they offered me a lift there with them in their air conditioned 4WD.
Score! Sure beats the bus!</p>

<p>I found Santa Teresa to be a much nicer place than Montezuma. There&#8217;s a long
surf beach going for kilometres in either direction, mostly with a sandy bottom
perfect for learning.</p>

<p>I walked the whole length of the beach on the day I arrived to get an idea where
places were, all the way down to Playa Carmen; a long enough walk that my legs
were sore afterwards.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14699346436/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Boards in the surf shop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3910/14699346436_f7fe1aa431_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Boards in the surf shop" class="img-responsive"><em>Boards in the surf shop</em></a></span></p>

<p>I took a surf lesson with Al Chilli Surf Shop, with a group consisting of two
German girls and a Korean girl. We were shown how to jump up, practiced on the
sand a bunch of times and then went out into the surf with the instructor
holding the board and telling us to paddle and jump up as the waves came
through.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14742224093/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Francisco and me by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3864/14742224093_c67dbbdf08_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Francisco and me" class="img-responsive"><em>Francisco and me</em></a></span></p>

<p>I managed to get up and ride the wave all the way in a few times, and towards
the end managed a few times completely unassisted; I was pretty happy with that!</p>

<p>I happened to be in Santa Teresa at the time of a full moon, and one of the
beach bars was having a big full moon party which I went along to with some
people from the hostel. It was a pretty big night with loads of people. I got to
practice some Spanish on some locals and didn&#8217;t get home until the sun was up.</p>

<p>I felt like crap the next day, awake by 9am because of the heat, but I went out
surfing anyway because I had 24 hours of free board rental with my lesson. I was
really struggling to paddle hard enough because I was so tired, but still got up
a few times.</p>

<p>I had not been paying enough attention and the current took me about a kilometre
down along the beach. When I came back in I had no idea where. It took me ages
to figure out which direction I needed to walk to get back, barefoot on the hot
road, then back down to the beach to get my flip-flops.</p>

<p>I went out again the next afternoon with a bit more energy and seemed to be
getting up a bit more easily, but most of the waves were just dumping over in
one go, so you couldn&#8217;t properly catch them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14722051542/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Kaya by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2926/14722051542_4ff893ee25_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Kaya" class="img-responsive"><em>Kaya</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ran into Kaya, one of the German girls from the lesson, and her boyfriend
Francisco and hung out with them for the afternoon and organised to meet up
early the next day for a surf. I also went back to the shop and swapped out my
giant 2.8 metre board for an 2.6 metre one, to see how I went with a shorter one
the next day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535901417/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Francisco, Kaya and me having breakfast by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3866/14535901417_5b2d7f0e6b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Francisco, Kaya and me having breakfast" class="img-responsive"><em>Francisco, Kaya and me having breakfast</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next morning we were in the surf at 6am and the waves were pretty good for
about half an hour, but then the surf went flat so we went and had breakfast
together, before going our separate ways for the day, with me having a good nap.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14742224093/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Francisco and me by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3864/14742224093_c67dbbdf08_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Francisco and me" class="img-responsive"><em>Francisco and me</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went back down to the beach at 3pm for another surf and the waves were much
better. I actually managed to catch a couple before they had fully broken, a
sensation that feels much faster and a whole lot more fun. I ran into Kaya and
Francisco again and it turned out they were heading up the peninsula in their
car the next day, the same direction as me, and offered me a lift to Liberia.
Score!</p>

<p>The drive up the peninsula had roads of quite varying quality. From Santa Teresa
to the close ferry port was pretty OK. From there to the far ferry port was
crazy bumpy and torn up so we crawled along very slowly for that part, but once
we were past there the roads were pretty great so we made good time.</p>

<p>Kaya and Francisco kindly dropped me off at a nice little hotel in Liberia,
where I spent my last night in Costa Rica before getting the bus to the
Nicaraguan border early in the morning.</p>

      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14512293446/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Puerto Jiminez by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5531/14512293446_1ce22f82a2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Puerto Jiminez" class="img-responsive"><em>Puerto Jiminez</em></a></span></p>

<p>After Poi Love Camp finished up I ended up travelling around Costa Rica for a
while with a guy I&#8217;ll just call ‘T&#8217;, together with a friend of his from France
who I&#8217;ll just call ‘A&#8217;. We headed up to San Jose to meet up with ‘A&#8217; at the
airport, then got a very long bus all the way down to the south eastern end of
the country to Golfito, where we stayed a night before getting a ferry over to
Puerto Jiminez the next day. The ferry was actually a cramped tiny little boat,
with so little room that our bags just got put up on the roof with no rope to
tie them down or railings to keep them up there. I was very pleased there were
still there when we reached the other side.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14348904158/in/set-72157645539710311" title="My first wild Macaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2897/14348904158_5756de5a83_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My first wild Macaw" class="img-responsive"><em>My first wild Macaw</em></a></span></p>

<p>Right upon getting on land we saw our first wild scarlet macaws, beautiful big
red birds, fidgeting around eating in a tree. There were heaps of them around
down here, especially around the soccer field. It was not uncommon to see 5-6 of
them in the big trees along there. We also saw a wild toucan and a few large
tenasaurs in a tree directly out the front of someones home. Who needs tv when
you&#8217;ve got cool shit like that in your front yard?</p>

<p>We tracked down the tourism office to sort out permits for Corcovado National
Park, a drawn out process that involved getting a form from the office at one
end of town, going over to the bank at the other end of town to pay for the
permit, then going all the way back to the office with the receipt to get the
actual passes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14534495162/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Colourful houses in Puerto Jiminez by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2901/14534495162_302cd53ce9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Colourful houses in Puerto Jiminez" class="img-responsive"><em>Colourful houses in Puerto Jiminez</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were no camping passes available for the next day, so the other two opted
to get a day pass to walk in and around a bit, while I took a day to relax and
prepare for the 20 km hike into the camp ground where we would spend 2 nights
before hiking 20 km back out again, carrying in a tent and enough food and water
to survive three days.</p>

<p>At a vote of two against me, we opted not to go with a guide to save some money.
I later found out that as of the day we returned, it is now a requirement that
everyone uses a guide when they visit the park, so depending on how you look at
it we either got lucky (or unlucky) with our timing.</p>

<p>Even this early on I was getting the feeling this travel arrangement wasn&#8217;t
going to last long; ‘A&#8217; seemed like a bit of a fool to me, and the two of them
would speak together in French most of the time which was leaving me feeling
completely isolated, but I figured it would be worth sticking together for the
hike into the park at least for safety.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14532104671/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Decorative security bars on the window by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2933/14532104671_6f8edda7a7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Decorative security bars on the window" class="img-responsive"><em>Decorative security bars on the window</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent my day alone getting some laundry done, sorting out tent rental for all
of us, and getting food supplies for myself. We hadn&#8217;t discussed food beforehand
and I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should get stuff for them as well or what, but I got
myself a lot of energy dense food so I was sure I&#8217;d have enough to make it in
and back again comfortably without carrying too much weight. Basically a can of
tuna for every meal, some mixed nuts and some muesli bars and a 2.5 litres of
water.  I was a bit worried about the water being sufficient for the heat and
the distance, but with the food and the tent my bag was going to weigh a ton
already.</p>

<p>‘T&#8217; and ‘A&#8217; returned that evening, quite sunburnt and tired, warning me it was
going to be quite a difficult hike the next day and checking if I&#8217;d gotten food
for myself.</p>

<p>We were up at 5:15 the next morning to pack up out stuff we were leaving at the
hostel, and get the bus to Carate. A guy with a 4WD ended up offering to drive
us there for a comparable price so we went with that speedier option, and were
lucky enough to have an Ocelot run across the road right in front of us. A
pretty amazing sighting to start the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14555646753/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Birds Fishing by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3924/14555646753_68106e6bbc_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Birds Fishing" class="img-responsive"><em>Birds Fishing</em></a></span></p>

<p>When we arrive and get dropped off at the beach, instead of making a start
quickly and trying to get as much of the walk over with before the heat sets in,
I find out ‘T&#8217; has lost his lighter and so is trying to light his cigarette with
a magnifying glass, while ‘A&#8217; starts unpacking and repacking his backpack,
leaving me waiting around in full sun for 15 minutes while they fuck around,
eventually giving up on the smoke.</p>

<p>After we finally get going we make it maybe 400-500 metres down the back before
‘T&#8217; decides to stop again in full sun and try again. Not putting up with that
shit, I duck up to the tree line and sit in the shade watching the hundreds of
hermit crabs and lizards doing their thing, sensibly in the shade.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14349063487/in/set-72157645539710311" title="The whole beach to ourselves by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2915/14349063487_0b25cc2cc4_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The whole beach to ourselves" class="img-responsive"><em>The whole beach to ourselves</em></a></span></p>

<p>Eventually we make it to the first ranger station, about 2km in, and check in,
after which it is decided we need to have a rest. Keep in mind this is a 20km
hike we are attempting to make it to the camping ranger station.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14555674143/in/set-72157645539710311" title="This tractor has seen better days by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2923/14555674143_d82c8b6aea_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="This tractor has seen better days" class="img-responsive"><em>This tractor has seen better days</em></a></span></p>

<p>We get going again and are stopped another 5 minutes later because ‘A&#8217; realises
he&#8217;s left his sunglasses behind. It is like an episode of Fawlty Towers with
these guys.</p>

<p>We come to our first water crossing, a small stream no more than 50cm deep. ‘T&#8217;
carefully hops on rocks across it, and make it safely across. I take off my
shoes and socks, cross the knee deep water and put them back on again, also
keeping my shoes and socks dry. ‘A&#8217; just trudges right on across in his shoes,
with some 16 odd km left to walk that day. I really start to wonder about his
common sense, and experience in the outdoors.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14534620122/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Bizzare 'door' root by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3849/14534620122_85c353b303_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Bizzare 'door' root" class="img-responsive"><em>Bizzare &#8216;door&#8217; root</em></a></span></p>

<p>After about 6km of fairly intense sweaty hiking, we stop and have a rest and eat
something for lunch. After resting for a while ‘T&#8217; tells me that he and ‘A&#8217; are
going to return back tomorrow because they didn&#8217;t bring enough food. No fucking
shit! Your single tin of tuna, a sandwich, some bananas and a muesli bar each
aren&#8217;t enough for 3 days of intense fucking hiking. Even less so when you
started eating them the night before.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400863197/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Yet another rest stop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2920/14400863197_9c387b05d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Yet another rest stop" class="img-responsive"><em>Yet another rest stop</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty mad at this point. My bag weighs a ton because I brought enough food
for 3, maybe even 4 days, having factored in the possibility of getting lost and
some extra to share, and now it seems like I&#8217;m going to carry most of it back if
we only stay the one night in there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400757908/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Ant eater foraging by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5273/14400757908_840b034c22_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Ant eater foraging" class="img-responsive"><em>Ant eater foraging</em></a></span></p>

<p>After this it starts to really grate on me that 95% of conversion is in French
(admittedly I can&#8217;t say I wouldn&#8217;t do the same if roles were reversed), and lots
of sightings don&#8217;t get shared with me. I keep telling myself it is better to be
with them for safeties sake at least.</p>

<p>As we walk we see some good wildlife. Quite a lot of coati and ant eaters
wandering on the forest floor and macaws in the trees overhead.</p>

<p>‘T&#8217; and ‘A&#8217; want to stop and rest every half km, but them seem to be in a huge
rush in the shade and dawdle along slowly in the sun. WTF?</p>

<p>‘A&#8217; is constantly stopping to mess around with his waterlogged shoes, taking out
the inner soles, turning his socks inside out. Who could have possibly foreseen
this would be an issue? Who?!?</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14585582894/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Waiting at the river crossing by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5550/14585582894_5bde373b57_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waiting at the river crossing" class="img-responsive"><em>Waiting at the river crossing</em></a></span></p>

<p>After nearly a whole day of walking we come to a big river, at least 20m across,
looking fairly deep and fast flowing. There are some other hikers resting with
their guide, waiting for the water level to drop. After an hour their guide
disappears to check if they can cross somewhere else. He comes back and tells
his customers he thinks they they can, and they promptly get up and get moving.
I say that I think we should follow them. ‘T&#8217; agrees. ‘A&#8217; fucks around for 10
minutes with his shoes so by the time we get moving there&#8217;s no trace of them.
Wonderful!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400922688/in/set-72157645539710311" title="It's deceiving but thats waist deep and flowing very very strongly by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3858/14400922688_9c522cac3e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="It's deceiving but thats waist deep and flowing very very strongly" class="img-responsive"><em>It&#8217;s deceiving but thats waist deep and flowing very very strongly</em></a></span></p>

<p>We head in the direction we saw them go and come out on the beach again, to find
them wading through the waist deep mouth of the river, everyone with their shoes
and pants off. We follow suit. The current is actually scarily strong but we all
make it across safely.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14607600793/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Here is where we actually crossed the river.

Great time to wash your stupid white pants!" class="img-responsive"><em>Here is where we actually crossed the river. Great time to wash your stupid white pants!</em></a></span></p>

<p>Everyone puts back on their pants, cleans off their feet and puts their shoes
on. Except of course ‘A&#8217;, who takes some photos of a stork, and decides now is a
good time to wash his white pants in the river (seriously, white pants trekking
in the jungle?).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400967469/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Still fucking around by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2934/14400967469_27b7cec509_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Still fucking around" class="img-responsive"><em>Still fucking around</em></a></span></p>

<p>By the time he&#8217;s ready to go everyone we were following (in the end, about 10
people and two different guides) are completely out of sight.  We follow foot
prints but they disappear into the dunes with super thick vegetation and stop
being at all obvious.</p>

<p>We venture into the scrub a little, and almost right away get split up. I find a
promising looking clearing and go back out to the beach to find the other guys.</p>

<p>I find ‘A&#8217; knee deep in the surf, washing his feet with his shoes off yet again.
‘T&#8217; doesn&#8217;t want to head into the jungle without knowing for certain where the
path is.  The sun is less than half an hour from setting. I regret us not having a
guide more than ever at this point.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400967469/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Still fucking around by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2934/14400967469_27b7cec509_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Still fucking around" class="img-responsive"><em>Still fucking around</em></a></span></p>

<p>They want to double back to where we crossed the river to try and find another
path. We do. They fail. ‘A&#8217; takes off his shoes again, just for a change.</p>

<p>Eventually I convince them to follow me into the forest, using the logic that if
there&#8217;s a path there, we just need to head in perpendicular from the beach to
find it. Sure enough I come to the path after about 200m of jungle stumbling. We
race along it in the face of lessening light from an already set sun, finally
coming to the camp as it gets dark! Success!</p>

<p>I put up my tent; it is a plain old dome tent so it is a pretty straightforward,
a 5 minute job. When I&#8217;m done I notice that the other two are still discussing
how the poles should go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m dripping with sweat, every inch of fabric I&#8217;m wearing is drenched, so I end
up showering in my clothes. Not having expected showers way out here, 20km into
the jungle I brought neither a change of clothes, nor a towel. It is a
refreshing shower, but the heavy humidity I think it might be a mistake.</p>

<p>I make the decision that I&#8217;m not going back the next day. I need to rest and I&#8217;d
rather risk being solo than have the liability of travelling with these guys.
I say goodbye to ‘T&#8217;. It is honestly a shame to split from him because he&#8217;s a
genuinely nice guy, but I just can&#8217;t stand ‘A&#8217;. I say instinctively &#8220;it was nice
to meet you&#8221; when saying goodbye to to ‘A&#8217; and he actually laughs at me. The
arrogant fuck! I definitely made the right choice going my own way; another day
with him and I&#8217;d probably be on trial for manslaughter.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401077858/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Morning sun rays by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3871/14401077858_b7472f0409_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Morning sun rays" class="img-responsive"><em>Morning sun rays</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got up the next day and head out into the jungle for a walk along some of the
paths. I followed the path back to the river to check how difficult it looks to
cross early in the morning. It appears infinitely easier to cross at low tide.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401058870/in/set-72157645539710311" title="The narrow river crossing at low tide by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2933/14401058870_d1730cc65d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The narrow river crossing at low tide" class="img-responsive"><em>The narrow river crossing at low tide</em></a></span></p>

<p>I walked on along the path a bit further to investigate any other possible river
crossings but I didn&#8217;t find any. Eventually I came to a fork for the Corcovado
trail, the long loop. I know it is the long loop because I have a photo of the
map on my phone.</p>

<p>I decided to head up there, and quickly find it becomes a very steep, uphill
trail, and not very worn. There&#8217;s lots of leaves on the ground that don&#8217;t look
like they&#8217;ve had much foot traffic on them so I figure people don&#8217;t go that way
very often. I hope that maybe more animals hang out there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401173659/in/set-72157645539710311" title="The trail of death by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2919/14401173659_28790d21ab_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The trail of death" class="img-responsive"><em>The trail of death</em></a></span></p>

<p>I managed see some monkeys up in the trees, but they&#8217;re pretty far away and fast
moving but I tried to keep up with them along the path for a while before they
eventually disappear.</p>

<p>At this stage the path is almost non existent and heading downhill, but there
are ribbon markers tied to trees every so often to mark the trail. I venture on,
losing the path a few times but eventually seeing another marker ribbon and
continuing on. Thankfully somewhere around here I pulled out my phone to have a
look on the GPS just where I was. No signal but the maps are cached at least.
More on that later.</p>

<p>I come to a place with two markers right next to one another but no obvious path
onward. I push on a bit and find one more marker, but from there I can not find
another one. I give up and decide to just  go back before I get lost.</p>

<p>I find my way back to the two markers next to one another, but can not see the
path back from there. I stumble back up the hill a bit, but there are spider
webs everywhere which means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I have to walk through icky spider webs</li>
  <li>This definitely isn&#8217;t the way I came</li>
</ol>

<p>I really start to panic quite a lot that I&#8217;m lost and no one knows where I am.
Way to go genius! This is how it feels to be that guy from the article in the
newspaper who stupidly died lost, alone in the forest.</p>

<p>I blow the whistle on the strap of my bag as hard as I can. Nobody hears it.</p>

<p>In the stupidity that you get in a state of panic, I run up the hill in the hope
the path will somehow reappear. It doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I start to feel pretty hopeless about ever finding the path. I think that maybe
I will have to to have to make my own path back towards the beach and hope for
the best.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401124590/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Life saving iPhone screenshot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3879/14401124590_46ba23e470_c.jpg" width="451" height="800" alt="Life saving iPhone screenshot" class="img-responsive"><em>Life saving iPhone screenshot</em></a></span></p>

<p>I pull out my iPhone and use the compass to find where I think the direction of
the beach is. It seems to be 90º from where I thought I came from, but using the
iPhone makes me realise I&#8217;d looked at the map on it earlier in the hike, so
there&#8217;s a GPS dot on there that is definitely on the path. I open Google maps
and quickly drop a map marker before the location updates so I know where I was
earlier. It confirms that up the hill is the way I need to go, so I trudge up
there, still without any sign of markers or any path. It is very very steep, not
an easy climb at all.</p>

<p>After 10 minutes of stumbling up the steep hill I&#8217;m getting close to the map
marker and I suddenly I come across something that looks like the path. The
immense relief that washes over me is indescribable.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14564730026/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Dont turn right here without a guide by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3836/14564730026_f0c13ae391_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Dont turn right here without a guide" class="img-responsive"><em>Dont turn right here without a guide</em></a></span></p>

<p>I backtrack back to the fork where I chose the long loop, and continue round the
other loop back to camp and decide I&#8217;m done with hiking for the day. Heck, I was
done for the month, but I still had the 20km hike back out of the park ahead of
me.</p>

<p>I have another shower in my clothes, hang my shirt out to dry, and then rest in
the shade of the base camp building, and eat some food and read all afternoon. I
actually ended up finishing a full book that afternoon; something I haven&#8217;t done
in years.</p>

<p>The next day I woke up nice and early to pack down my tent and get a head start
before the heat really started.</p>

<p>When I got to the river it was was at a much lower tide this time. I still hang
around next to the river and wait on someone else to cross first, so there&#8217;s at
least someone around if I get swept out to sea. The water is only to my knees
this time, but the current is strong enough to knock you down if you lost your
footing. Lots of baby steps.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14612415013/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Shipwreck? by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3917/14612415013_1485f19c06_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Shipwreck?" class="img-responsive"><em>Shipwreck?</em></a></span></p>

<p>The walk back is pretty long and uneventful. I unintentionally take an alternate
route for part of the walk that goes by what looks like both some old rusted
mining equipment in the sea, and the remains of a long-ago rusted-away
shipwreck, evidence of a large winch and drive shaft and lots of rusted sheet
metal.</p>

<p>I saw some really big foot prints on the beach, that I thought might be a big
cat, but identifying them against the chart at the last ranger station I think
they were the prints of a tapir.</p>

<p>I also saw a Tayra, a black cat like animal with a bears head, wandering along
with something in its mouth. I was much too slow to get my camera to get a photo
though.</p>

<p>I made it back to the bus station in 5.5 hours, nearly half the amount of time
it took to get in. It was far less stressful and there was far less fucking
about doing it solo.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14405866068/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Wild macaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5559/14405866068_5d27d7fe0c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wild macaw" class="img-responsive"><em>Wild macaw</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the bus station I had a beer, and met the very unpleasant Canadian ex-pat
owner of the store there. He had a whinge at me about my taking off my shoes to
try and dry out my sweat waterlogged feet. Then complained that the locals were
all filthy and never washed their hands. He just generally whinged a lot, even
more than I have in this blog post, and that&#8217;s a fair bit.</p>

<p>He said he&#8217;s lived there for 25 years, right on the edge of the park, but he
says that only been into the park once. He claims to have seen all the big cats,
and that because of that there&#8217;s no point going into the park. I could not wait
to get away from the guy.</p>

<p>I ended up getting a lift back to town with a Swedish couple, Carolyn and
Niklas, who had a guide and so weren&#8217;t stuck waiting for the buses last in the
afternoon. They were a really nice couple and I can&#8217;t thank them enough for
rescuing me from the whinger at the shop.</p>

<p>The shower when I get back to the hotel is the greatest moment in anyone&#8217;s life
ever. Being clean and not drenched in sweat is extremely novel and enjoyable.</p>

<p>I spent the evening hanging out drinking beers with Carolyn and Niklas, The
perfect way to celebrate not having died alone in the dense Costa Rican jungle!</p>

<p>Poi Love Camp was an 11 day retreat focused on becoming better poi spinners,
held in Costa Rica, and run by Nick Woolsey, the man behind
<a href="http://www.playpoi.com">PlayPoi</a>. Also teaching there was one of the spinners
who has inspired me the most: Jonathan Alvarez, and also the mind-bendingly
talented Alien Jon.</p>

<p>The retreat had been on my radar for a little while, but it wasn&#8217;t until a few
days before Christmas when I decided that I really wanted to get out of the
European winter that I started seriously thought about going. A day later I had
bought flights and tickets to what ended up being one of the most fun fortnights
I&#8217;ve ever had. Impulsive travel planning at it&#8217;s best.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14349420794/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Finca Mia by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3865/14349420794_0733e78d5a_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Finca Mia" class="img-responsive"><em>Finca Mia</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was held at a property right next to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Chirrip%C3%B3">Cerro
Chirripó</a> called Finca Mia, a
beautiful eco-retreat up in the hills, with a pretty little river running
through the property.</p>

<p>Just about everyone attending stayed at the same hotel in San Jose for a night
on arrival, so we could all get driven out to the site together in a minivan the
next day. It was astonishing cool to come down for breakfast and find Nick,
Jonathan and Jon all seated around a table talking about poi. The guys from the
videos you&#8217;ve watched over and over, trying to work out what sort of voodoo
they&#8217;re using to pull off tricks that appear to defy physics, now right there in
front of you, and you&#8217;re eating breakfast with them. I was actually kind of star
struck for most of the first day and felt too intimated to actually even spin in
front of those guys.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14163597899/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Pool time, sunscreening up my head by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2902/14163597899_980c379513_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Pool time, sunscreening up my head" class="img-responsive"><em>Pool time, sunscreening up my head</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was some pool side video making in the morning with Nick and Jonathan
trying to spin underwater, and general mingling and getting to meet everyone
there.</p>

<p>The minivan ride was lots of fun, everyone discussing how they got started
spinning, how long they&#8217;d been doing it etc. There were some great stories told,
but I think Jonathan&#8217;s story telling abilities deserve a special mention, he&#8217;s
nearly as good at story telling as he is at poi. But stories told at Poi Love
Camp, stay at Poi Love Camp :P</p>

<p>Every time the van would stop for any reason, people would jump out and start
spinning, to the amusement/confusion of the local Ticos, many of who&#8217;d never
seen anything like it.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Finca Mia I got lucky and ended up with a cabin to myself
called the sunrise cabin. It only had 3 walls and a curtain for the fourth wall,
facing the direction that the sun rises. It was kind of surreal having a room
that just opened straight out into the forest!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14327238376/in/set-72157645015360162" title="My cabin from below by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5514/14327238376_e163a315b8_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="My cabin from below" class="img-responsive"><em>My cabin from below</em></a></span></p>

<p>As the sun set that first evening, loads and loads of fireflies started to
appear; at first I wasn&#8217;t sure it wasnt just that thing where skin cells in your
eyes float around and sparkle, but I got up close to one with a light and saw it
really was a glowing little bug. They made the place feel like a some sort of
magical pixi-land with little glowing dots all along the pathways. There was
actually quite a lot of wild life on the property, loads of lizards,
hummingbirds, even an armadillo that came stumbling through on occasion!</p>

<p>It was really lovely getting to get to know everyone at camp. Everybody was very
friendly and approachable and after a few days it felt like I&#8217;d known these
people for a whole lot longer than I had.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14163685890/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Looking in to the yoga deck by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3902/14163685890_65c2b86dab_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Looking in to the yoga deck from the balcony" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking in to the yoga deck from the balcony</em></a></span></p>

<p>Days largely consisted of yoga first thing in the morning, followed by a very
varied and delicious organic breakfast and some time to relax or go for a quick
swim. I stuck it out with the yoga for about a week before giving in and coming
to terms that my calves and hamstrings have become way too tight for most of the
poses these days. One day I&#8217;ll have to really focus on getting some of the
flexibility back I lost while I was injured, but attempting poses way beyond my
limits isn&#8217;t the right path to that.</p>

<p>A bit later we&#8217;d spend a few hours leading up to lunch back up on the yoga deck
working on various poi skills with a big focus on getting the basics super
solid, various methods of counting/timing to fit better with music, performance
and choreography.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14346986521/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Poiruvian man synchro by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5155/14346986521_f9e1a71ab8_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Poiruvian man synchro" class="img-responsive"><em>Poiruvian man synchro</em></a></span></p>

<p>Lunch would be another healthy buffet of amazing food, followed by a bit more
free time in which I often took the chance to swim in the river. The water was a
little bit fresh but very refreshing when you&#8217;re all hot and sweaty from the
mornings activities, and it was lovely to warm up in the sun on the rocks
afterwards.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14163690908/in/set-72157645015360162" title="The river by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2924/14163690908_39c20c6aa1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The river" class="img-responsive"><em>The river</em></a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoons we&#8217;d head back up to the yoga deck for more workshops, often
building on the stuff from the morning, or practicing a choreographed piece that
Nick had us working towards to film for a video.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14327155646/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Classes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5197/14327155646_5fd1d8a550_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Learning choreography" class="img-responsive"><em>Learning choreography</em></a></span></p>

<p>Dinner would be another organic feast. One night we had some soft-shell tacos
and they were pretty much the best tacos I&#8217;ve ever tasted!</p>

<p>I learned loads of stuff in a short period, and became aware of a number of weak
spots in my basic skills that I needed to work on. I&#8217;ve previously learned a lot
things only in anti-clockwise, so while I can do a lot of different things I&#8217;m
often limited in what I can move between seamlessly because I&#8217;m not comfortable
with the direction required to do so. It&#8217;s good to have realised that it&#8217;s a
problem so I can go back and focus on the basics for all the different
permutations to make everything flow together a little more easily.</p>

<p>We did some good exercises about developing left/right independence. Sort of
like the old rubbing-your-tummy-while-patting-your-head, but on steroids. It&#8217;s
actually kind of funny to see how badly behaved my left hand can be when I&#8217;m
doing something else with my right. Either hand can do it&#8217;s part separately
easily, but combined the left just falls apart. These skills become really
important for Hybrids where one hand traces out one pattern while the other
traces out a completely different one, creating some very beautiful
combinations.</p>

<p>A lot of time was spent on footwork techniques to turn more smoothly and with
less effort, and spotting while turning to reduce dizziness when repeatedly
turning in the same direction. This seems to be stuff that people with a dance
background have very little trouble with but having never really learnt to dance
I found quite difficult. Thankfully a little bit of practice has improved things
a lot but I still need to work on this a lot.</p>

<p>We did some work on counting different parts of motion in order to fit patterns
to music better. Counting downbeats feels really natural to most people, but
doing so means that most patterns repeat on an odd number, which when put to 4/4
music makes things complicated. For something simple like a 3-beat weave, you&#8217;re
stuck repeating it 4 times over 3 bars of music before things line up again.</p>

<p>While I can follow the theory about this stuff, I struggled really hard to
actually find the beat a lot of the time. I know people joke about having no
rhythm, but it honestly feels like the part of my brain that should help with
this is seriously underdeveloped.</p>

<p>Nick had a set of <a href="http://lighttoys.pyroterra.cz/visual-poi-staff-v3/">Pyroterra Visual
Poi</a> at the retreat which he
was kind enough to let me have a go of. From the first time I saw these on a
video on Youtube I&#8217;ve been in awe, and then when I saw the $1500 price I was in
even more awe. Getting to actually spin them was amazingly, fun and kind of
disorienting (they&#8217;re super bright), but also kind of terrifying. I&#8217;m sure
they&#8217;re probably pretty tough, but the though of having to pay for them if they
got broken meant I was probably more worried spinning them than I&#8217;ve ever been
with fire.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rXfYzFGL99Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>Jon and Jonathan brought along a lot of (at the time) not-yet-for-sale Flowtoys
products which we all got to play around with. Lots of stuff from the new
modular capsule line-up, capsule handles, compact capsule flower-cap poi, dual
capsule tube poi, even capsule staffs! The capsule handles are so nice I&#8217;m
pretty much converted to the idea of lit up handles, and I really liked the
compact flower-cap poi.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14350320165/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Hot springs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5571/14350320165_c6a9d0c105_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hot springs" class="img-responsive"><em>Hot springs</em></a></span></p>

<p>We made a couple of excursions out into the local area. One day we made a visit
to the nearby hot springs. There&#8217;s natural warm water coming down the hill, but
it&#8217;s been routed into some concrete pools to make the bodies of water big enough
to really swim it. It was a very relaxing way to spend a few hours just hanging
out enjoying the water.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="1280" height="720" src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com//www.youtube.com/embed/DPQi4KNHonM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>We got invited to come along to a local festival and rodeo where the group
performed in the bull ring with LED poi. The PA did not have any way to connect
an iPod so we ended up spinning to their selection of music, some Latin-American
pop music songs from the charts. The crowd loved it and some people were even
actually asking afterwards about getting the group to perform at other events.
It was my first time in front of a big crowd and it was heaps of fun.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6n_n9iDN5Do?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>After the performance Jonathan decided he wanted to spin poi in the ring with
the bulls. The locals weren&#8217;t so keen on him doing this, but they he was able to
partner up with a local guy who was shitfaced drunk, and tried to tie up a baby
bull. The guy had somehow miscommunicated that Jonathan should try and tie up
the bull&#8217;s back legs up while the local guy grabbed it around the neck, which
lead to some hilarious attempts to get it tied up while the announcer heckled
him in Spanish.</p>

<p>One morning some of us made a visit to the local chocolate maker in the village.
It was run by a lady named Tao, who showed us how they made their chocolate,
grinding the cocoa beans in a juicer with some cocoa butter, then put in a
conching machine that rolled the chocolate over for 3 days to get it silky
smooth. We then got to take a batch from 3 days ago and make our own blocks of
chocolate with our own choice of added flavourings.  I made mine with crushed
coffee beans, chilli flakes and sea salt. It turned out really tasty and didn&#8217;t
last long after I started eating it.</p>

<p>Another day the whole group took a trip to a nearby beach for the day, Playa
Dominical. We had a nice lunch when we arrived, then went out in the surf and
did some body surfing. It was incredibly fun and reminded me how much I enjoy the
ocean. We had our afternoon poi class by the shore, then had dinner at a local
restaurant before making the trip back to the finca.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14350077512/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Nick spinning by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5545/14350077512_559e9d5538_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Nick spinning" class="img-responsive"><em>Nick spinning</em></a></span></p>

<p>We had two nights of spinning fire right at the end of the retreat, as we had
some issues getting our hands on suitable fuel to burn. It was the first time
I&#8217;d spun with fire since way back in Thailand, so I was a little timid about it
and only felt up to spinning the first night, but it was great to see everyone
else busting out their best performances. Especially enjoyable were Thomas
spinning like a mad man to some crazy French psy-trance, AlienJon&#8217;s
beautifully synchronized slow swinging pendulums to an Ott song, and Nick
spinning to &#8220;I&#8217;m too sexy&#8221; :P</p>

<p>After everything was done and dusted I hung around at Finca Mia for an extra few
days afterwards. It was sad to see the group diminish but great to get to spend
some extra time with the others who stayed on.</p>

<p>For Christmas 2013, My Melbourne friends Leigh and Nicolette who currently live
in Edinburgh kindly offered to have myself and our English mate Matty P come
stay with them, so I had sorted out my flight from Spain to go straight there.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><i>Side note: My apologies about the lack of photos to go with the first half of
this post, I got super slack with photography over Christmas and was having too
much fun with friends.</i></p>

<p>On arrival I had a minor freak out where my bag hadn&#8217;t come out at baggage
collection, which contained pretty much all of my warm clothes. Thoughts of
spending Christmas day in Scotland in shorts and a T-shirt went through my head.
It turned out there were about 10 other people with the same issue, and what has
happened was that one bag had gotten stuck on the other side of the conveyor
belt and knocked a dozen bags off out the back.</p>

<p>I got rugged up and then got the bus into the city to meet up with Leigh and
Nicolette, and their reaction on my arrival about my giant moustache was just
the kind I was hoping, awe and disbelief.</p>

<p>We got another bus out to their place at Leith to drop off my bags, then headed
out to have dinner at a nice pub nearby their house. The place made a great
rabbit burger, and we caught up and talked about past and future travel plans.</p>

<p>Leigh had to work the next day, Christmas eve, so Nic and I hung out for the day
and got things together for the Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>We were actually house sitting for Nic&#8217;s workmate Dave, so we took my bags with
us and dropped them off at their office, then went out and had an amazing
Scottish breakfast for just £4. It had everything; bacon, eggs, flat sausage,
round sausages, black pudding, beans. So unhealthy yet so very delicious.</p>

<p>We went down the street to the nearby Lidl and shopped for some pork to roast
and some veggies, and some bacon and eggs to make for  breakfast, then ducked
down to a big off licence to stock up on what seemed like plenty of beers.</p>

<p>We took it all back to the office and hung out there cutting out letters for a
very sweet video Nicolette put together for Leigh, and waiting for Dave to
finish at work so he could take us to his place before heading off to visit his
family.</p>

<p>Dave had kindly stocked his fridge with beers for us as well, and with bacon and
eggs and all sort of other good easy to prepare foods, so we definitely weren&#8217;t
going to be going thirsty or hungry.</p>

<p>Leigh arrived back from work and we cracked open some drinks and watched some
stuff on Netflix and kicked back. A bit later in the evening Matty P arrived,
who also had to work Christmas eve and then drive all the way up from
Nottingham. It was great to have everyone together in one place again.</p>

<p>The good times continued and we all stayed up until 4am, drinking beer, talking
shit and watching shows.</p>

<p>We woke up fairly late Christmas day, feeling pretty rough, but after a few
drinks our hangovers disappeared. We actually ran out of beer, even though it
felt like we had more there than we could possibly drink, but a nearby store was
open and we solved that problem pretty easily.</p>

<p>We prepared the pork roast and the veggies and put them in the oven, and we
rewarded a few hours later with a very delicious Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>On boxing day we finally made some use of the breakfast food we&#8217;d purchased and
made a feast of bacon, both kinds of sausage, eggs, bacon and beans. Epic as
always.</p>

<p>We cleaned up Dave&#8217;s place to leave it as we found it, then went out looking for
a pub where we could get haggis, neaps and tatties for a late lunch, to make
sure we ticked all of the boxes for a visit to Scotland.</p>

<p>We found a great place that had movie theatre seats with the names of all the
characters from train spotting and I got my haggis fix with a couple of nice
ales.</p>

<p>Matty let slip that he&#8217;d never been to Edinburgh before so we all decided we
should get a bus over to the royal mile, the street that leads up to Edinburgh
castle and have a walk around.</p>

<p>It was very pretty up there, but icy cold winds were blowing through, so we went
down the other side of the hill to the Grassmarket and had a beer in the oldest
pub in Edinburgh (Maybe even all of Scotland?). We had a look at a few other
pubs along the same strip before heading back to the house.</p>

<p>Matty offered that I could come back to Nottingham with him for NYE, and after
looking at the ludicrous prices of hostels in Edinburgh over that period it was
the only sensible choice. Places were asking £60-70 a night for a bed in a 16
person dorm. Fucking crazy!</p>

<p>Anyway, we said our goodbyes to Nicolette and Leigh and then set off on the
long drive from Edinburgh to Nottingham, 4-5 hours finally arriving at 1:30am.
It felt nice to be back at my home away from home again.</p>

<p>Between Christmas and New Years I spent a lot of time hacking on my blog,
dumping Tumblr as a platform because it didn&#8217;t fit well with my
not-always-online work flow.</p>

<p>We also revisited a few of my favourite bars around town, the Canal House and
Brewdog being the primary haunts, trying all the new ales they now had on tap.</p>

<p>For my birthday, New Years Eve, we got some tickets to go and see a chap-hop
rapper, Professor Elemental. For those who&#8217;ve never heard of chap-hop, it&#8217;s a
hilarious genre of hip-hop performed by very proper, steam-punk-esk British
gentlemen, rapping about important things like tea, being British and fighting
trousers. Here&#8217;s a video clip to give you an idea of what it&#8217;s like:</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eELH0ivexKA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>The night has a fancy dress steam punk theme, which made my moustache very well
received. I even had a few people so impressed that they were buying me drinks.
Sadly it didn&#8217;t seem to provoke such a positive response from the ladies :P</p>

<p>I got a chance to actually meet Professor Elemental before he was on, who said
that he was well jealous of the moustache and I got a few photos of us together.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14316422983/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Me and Professor Elemental by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5502/14316422983_7750822a98_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Me and Professor Elemental" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and Professor Elemental</em></a></span></p>

<p>His set was great, everyone was getting right into it and I even got name
checked during it. It was a really fun night and it was a great way to spend my
birthday.</p>

<p>A few days later on the weekend, Matty got a vehicle from work and we went on a
trip to see Bletchley Park, to top secret facility where they were cracking the
enigma codes during World War II.</p>

<p>We saw a bunch of enigma encryption devices and learnt a bit about how the work.
They have various code wheels that are each electrically wired differently, and
each have a number of modes, each set to a different letter, so that the input
letter undergoes many mutations. There was something like 80 million possible
ciphers for some of the devices, and they would change them every single day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14316430763/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Turing Bombe Rebuild Project by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3698/14316430763_46976068bc_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Turing Bombe Rebuild Project" class="img-responsive"><em>Turing Bombe Rebuild Project</em></a></span></p>

<p>The enigma devices were incredibly impressive themselves at the time, but then
the ‘bombe&#8217; code cracking devices used to mechanically switch through 30-40 full
sets of enigma code wheels simultaneously, searching for configurations that
were electrically complete were simply mind blowing. The machine would stop when
set of code wheels lined up in an electrically complete manner, and then that
configuration would be tested against a German message to see if it was the
correct code for the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109710727/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Opened Bombe by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3782/14109710727_a5baf3021b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Opened Bombe" class="img-responsive"><em>Opened Bombe</em></a></span></p>

<p>We even got to see a demonstration of their bombe recreation working, it was
quite a noisy sight to see.</p>

<p>There was some stories about several spies and double agents who were feeding
misinformation to the German secret service; some real James Bond style stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109701527/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Alan Turing statue by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3817/14109701527_66e8df2c80_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Alan Turing statue" class="img-responsive"><em>Alan Turing statue</em></a></span></p>

<p>They have a nice statue to Alan Turing, along with a copy of the British apology
for his treatment for being gay.</p>

<p>We ducked across to the nearby computer history museum to have a look around
there as well. They have a recreation of Colossus, the world&#8217;s first electronic
digital computer that was at all programmable. It was mammoth in size and crazy
noisy.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109618058/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Colossus recreation by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3689/14109618058_30802e5a5f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Colossus recreation" class="img-responsive"><em>Colossus recreation</em></a></span></p>

<p>They had a working PDP-11, complete with text adventure game, but sadly it
wasn&#8217;t powered up that afternoon. The thing was as big as 4-5 full height server
racks.</p>

<p>Another room had the oldest still functioning computer, buzzing away playing the
Monty Python theme music. So British!</p>

<p>They also had some other massive old computers, literally the size of a room !
You could actually hear them humming and processing as text would appear appear
on the screen.</p>

<p>Another interesting piece that had was the longest continuously functioning
computer, retired in the mid 2000s from a power plant. It had worked there for
something like 40 years straight without ever being restarted.</p>

<p>It was an awesome day out and I&#8217;m glad Matt kept suggesting that we should go
and do something that weekend. I had been not really looking for things I wanted
to do around England as I didn&#8217;t want to be a burden on Matt who already works
way too hard during the week. I realised though that Matt wanting to go do stuff
isn&#8217;t just about him trying to entertain his guest; it&#8217;s giving him a chance to
do stuff he wouldn&#8217;t go and do by himself, which I can relate to when I&#8217;m at
home.</p>

<p>On my last night in Nottingham we went out to the Linconshire Poacher for dinner
and I had a very tasty game meat casserole and a few nice ales to wash it down.
We finished off the night at Brewdog, going on a bit of a dark beer rampage,
trying their tactical nuclear penguin, dogma, espresso psycho and their
shipwrecker circus, all of which were amazing, and are often very difficult to
find beers.</p>

<p>The next day I woke up extremely hungover and unwell, but I had a train to
London to catch so I headed off to the station and caught my train. The train
felt fairly quick, even with me feeling nauseated at times, but I made it to
London OK and went and checked into my hostel and tried to sleep off the
hangover.</p>

<p>In the evening I went for a bit of a walk around London, from Charring Cross,
around Reagent Street to Piccadilly Circus and Soho, through China town and the
West End.</p>

<p>I made a visit to M&amp;M world, several floors packed with nothing but M&amp;Ms and M&amp;M
branded products. They had a rainbow of tubes full of M&amp;Ms which you could buy
as single colours or make your own mixes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14296293235/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Rainbow of M&amp;Ms by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2927/14296293235_48dac64c3c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rainbow of M&amp;Ms" class="img-responsive"><em>Rainbow of M&amp;Ms</em></a></span></p>

<p>I was woken up at 6:30am the next day by a real fire alarm evacuation, which had
everyone in the hostel out standing on the street in the freezing cold morning.
Some people had gone out barefoot without a jacket, which would have been hell.
It wasnt a very pleasant start to the day but I figured I&#8217;d take advantage of it
and didn&#8217;t go back to bed.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14273158356/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Firetruck outside the hotel, way too early in the morning by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3673/14273158356_66654fa019_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Firetruck outside the hotel, way too early in the morning" class="img-responsive"><em>Firetruck outside the hotel, way too early in the morning</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent the morning going around to a bunch of camera shops, having a look at
various models of pocketable cameras that still have a good amount of manual
controls, as I&#8217;d been thinking I&#8217;d like a smaller camera for my travels. Nothing
I saw had the features I&#8217;d like at a price I was happy to pay so I&#8217;m still using
my trusty GX1 to this day.</p>

<p>Later I went to Notting Hill to meet up with a guy from couchsurfing who had
organised a juggle jam there. On my way there I passed some cool markets along
Portobello road and even stumbled upon a Banksy piece.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109655028/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Banksy by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5536/14109655028_7ac2290690_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Banksy" class="img-responsive"><em>Banksy</em></a></span></p>

<p>It ended up just being the two of us there, but it was good to get in some
juggling practice and spend a bit of time spinning poi, and we had some
interesting conversation about how cheap it is to live on a houseboat in London
compared to a house, and these vipassana meditation retreats that he&#8217;d been on
where you&#8217;re pretty much meditating for a week, not really talking at all during
that time.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14316483513/in/set-72157644891794991" title="V &amp; A Museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3764/14316483513_39938d832d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="V &amp; A Museum" class="img-responsive"><em>V &amp; A Museum</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went to the Victoria &amp; Albert museum and had a quick run through as I&#8217;d heard
it was supposed to be amazing. I didn&#8217;t actually find the place very
interesting, although there were some impressive rooms in the building itself.</p>

<p>I ducked across from there and went back to the science museum. I saw lots of
medical related sections, and the history of medicine, but I ran out of time and
it closed before I was done AGAIN!</p>

<p>The next day I wandered around Camden markets some more, admiring all the
amazingly detailed steampunk style clothes they have. I&#8217;d really love to have an
outfit like that for dress ups at festivals but I&#8217;m not really in a position for
that right now.</p>

<p>I met up for dinner with my English friend Andrew, and Jarod,an Aussie mate who&#8217;s
working over in London at the moment.</p>

<p>We went out for dumplings at a place called Ping Pong Dim Sum. It was good to
catch up and the food was top notch, but OMG was it a lot more expensive than I
ever thought possible. £30 each! For dumplings!</p>

<p>I had a quite day starting with a long breakfast at a nice place called the
Inhibition cafe in Camden, then spent time catching up on my blog and watching
the new episode of Sherlock.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14273176316/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Me and a rare, sadly empty bottle of sink the bismark by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3755/14273176316_349a091396_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Me and a rare, sadly empty bottle of sink the bismark" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and a rare, sadly empty bottle of sink the bismark</em></a></span></p>

<p>I  the evening I went over to Brewdog Camden for a few quiet drinks, and got
talking with a few off-duty staff and the manager in one corner of the bar. I
ended up getting shouted a bunch of really nice barley wines by them. I recall
Evil Twin Brewing - Torst Front room being particularly delicious.</p>

<p>A night on the barely wine means a morning of feeling pretty awful, but a quick
trip back to the Inhibition cafe got my grease and fat levels up to a suitable
point for dealing with the hangover.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14292977201/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Epic face by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5313/14292977201_22b7622eae_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Epic face" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic face</em></a></span></p>

<p>I wandered through the back streets around behind Camden markets, taking some
photos of street art, and decided to hunt out more graffiti around London. I
headed over to Shoredich and spent the rest of the day being wowed by some of
the very creative pieces around in that part of the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109809537/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Off duty palace guard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3723/14109809537_ebf7ed43f4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Off duty palace guard" class="img-responsive"><em>Off duty palace guard</em></a></span></p>

<p>My last day in the UK I went and searched for an open op shop to donate back my
winter coat and unneeded jeans, but a lot of them don&#8217;t open at all on a Sunday
and those that do open quite late, so it turned out a lot more difficult than I
had expected but I got it done in the end.</p>

<p>After finding an American style cafe and having a nice bowl of chilli and a
chocolate and peanut butter milkshake for lunch, I took the tube out to Heathrow
to get my flight to the warm lands of Costa Rica.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14082912566/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Roman bridge of C&#xF3;rdoba by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2904/14082912566_5b0ed9bc2c_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Roman bridge of C&#xF3;rdoba" class="img-responsive"><em>Roman bridge of C&#xF3;rdoba</em></a></span></p>

<p>Next stop in Andalusia was a town named Córdoba that&#8217;s claim to fame is the
Mezquita, a Mosque-Cathedral. I arrived in the evening and explored around a
bit, finding the town to be almost completely deserted but did take some nice
photos of this Roman era bridge and tower.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The Internet tells you you should try and get to the Mezquita early in the
morning so you can get photos without all the crowds, but the Internet doesn&#8217;t
factor in not being able to get to sleep until 5am in the morning, so I instead
got up around noon and went and had lunch for breakfast, a dish with ox tail
that was extremely nice.</p>

<p>After I&#8217;d eaten I headed over to the courtyard outside the Mezquita, a huge open
space full of orange trees. In fact, all of Córdoba is pretty well decked out in
orange trees; they seem to be a very common decorative plant in Andalusia.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919408747/in/set-72157644463351646" title="The court of oranges by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2916/13919408747_13be1c076f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The court of oranges" class="img-responsive"><em>The court of oranges</em></a></span></p>

<p>I actually peeled one and tried it, and let me tell you: it tasted terrible.
The oranges on these trees are incredibly bitter and unpleasant. I asked someone
about it later to find out if maybe they just weren&#8217;t ripe yet, but it turns out
they&#8217;re just not the eating kind. I didn&#8217;t even know there were not-eating
oranges. That person thought they might even be toxic to humans, so it&#8217;s lucky
they taste awful enough that I spat out my first bite.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919504160/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Beautiful archway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2903/13919504160_495eca2d16_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Beautiful archway" class="img-responsive"><em>Beautiful archway</em></a></span></p>

<p>Anyhow, I paid my admission and went into the Mezquita and it seemed that
afternoon was the perfect time for a visit. The place was nearly deserted,
giving me a chance to get a bunch of &#8220;postcard&#8221; shots without tour groups
cluttering them up.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14106540995/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Endless arches by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2915/14106540995_369781e1f5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Endless arches" class="img-responsive"><em>Endless arches</em></a></span></p>

<p>The building is absolutely massive, probably 150-200 Meters long and the same
again wide, and decked out with hundreds of columns, all topped with candy cane
coloured arches. It&#8217;s very picturesque!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14083005976/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally. by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7304/14083005976_3ac0d2bd9a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally." class="img-responsive"><em>Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally.</em></a></span></p>

<p>The building was actually originally built as a mosque, and is apparently
regarded as one of the most accomplished monuments of Moorish architecture.
Córdoba was later captured from the Moors by a Catholic king so the building was
converted into a Catholic cathedral, adding many Christian features to the
building and converting the minaret into a bell tower.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919575399/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Giant renaissance cathedral nave by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7302/13919575399_bf03ff09f1_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Giant renaissance cathedral nave" class="img-responsive"><em>Giant renaissance cathedral nave</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was also this epic double organ with things up either side of the nave
(let&#8217;s hope I&#8217;m using that word right, I saw it on Wikipedia but didn&#8217;t care
enough to actually read the article), with pipes jutting out that made me think
of crazy drag-racing car exhausts.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919678087/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Organ pipes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2916/13919678087_789b8871e3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Organ pipes" class="img-responsive"><em>Organ pipes</em></a></span></p>

<p>After I&#8217;d taken 50 billion photos of arches I started playing around with my
camera settings and super long exposure shots to let me get some low ISO photos
with the fairly low lighting. A tripod would have been awesome, but I don&#8217;t own
one and they specifically disallow them there, so I made do with putting the
camera on various ledges.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14083226416/in/set-72157644463351646" title="I'm a ghost! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2913/14083226416_b46cff9418_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="I'm a ghost!" class="img-responsive"><em>I&#8217;m a ghost!</em></a></span></p>

<p>After doing a few I had the idea of running into the shot part way through the
exposure and standing still like a stature to try and get a transparent
ghost-like effect.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919732469/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Double ghost! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5555/13919732469_29bbd66bbb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Double ghost!" class="img-responsive"><em>Double ghost!</em></a></span></p>

<p>I then tried doing even longer exposure shots and running around stopping in multiple
places so I could be in the same photo two or more times, no Photoshop required!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14103168651/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Ghosts cast no shadow by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5271/14103168651_c3a3462bc7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ghosts cast no shadow" class="img-responsive"><em>Ghosts cast no shadow</em></a></span></p>

<p>I probably ended up spending more time messing around with crazy ideas for
photos than I did actually looking around the Mezquita. I had heaps of fun
figuring out what worked, and I think some of them turned out pretty awesome if
I do say so myself.</p>

<p>After Córdoba I got one of the speedy Renfe trains to Seville. A little digital
display in the train told me we were going 250km/hour, but it was still
wonderfully smooth and quite the whole time. I wish we had decent trains back
home in Australia.</p>

<p>I went on yet another free walking tour, led by a student from Columbia. The
tour itself was alright, but everyone on the tour seemed to be travelling in
groups of 2-4 and there wasn&#8217;t much inter-mingling so it didn&#8217;t feel very social
compared to some of the tours that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed.</p>

<p>I had heard from <a href="http://herecomestheplanet.com">Amanda and Luke</a> that Seville doesn&#8217;t
really live up to it&#8217;s reputation and I have to agree. Nothing we visited on the
tour really stood out for me, so here&#8217;s a token photo of Plaza de España with
all the water drained out.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921314810/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Plaza de Espa&#xF1;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7413/13921314810_d89de7e826_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Plaza de Espa&#xF1;a" class="img-responsive"><em>Plaza de Espa&#xF1;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>They did however recommend a fancy tapas place called <a href="http://laazoteasevilla.es/">La
Azotea</a> which was absolutely fantastic. I had some
smoked cheese, cooked wild mushrooms, and pork cheek; and all of it was amazing.
It was hands down the nicest tapas I came across; so good that I came back again
for dinner the same day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14jk128073893/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7039/14128073893_295d0227fd_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Intricate carved archway in the Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville" class="img-responsive"><em>Intricate carved archway in the Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville</em></a></span></p>

<p>I did get a tip from the tour guide that if I only visited once place, that the
Alcázar should be it, so after some difficulty actually locating it (Seville is
like a maze in the old part of the city) I checked it out.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14084997556/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5231/14084997556_dd797d2f95_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville" class="img-responsive"><em>Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville</em></a></span></p>

<p>The Alcázar is a stunning building and a royal palace. It has been added to by
each of the monarchs who have occupied it leading to a mix of a lot of different
styles from a lot of different periods in time.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14105067702/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Golden dome ceiling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7189/14105067702_14497fe666_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Golden dome ceiling" class="img-responsive"><em>Golden dome ceiling</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m really starting to appreciate the Moorish style of decoration, where because
their religion prohibits them from creating a likeness of things  they have lots
of intricate geometric patterns and carvings as decoration. I find it much more
visually pleasing decoration than paintings and statues.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14104838381/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Water feature by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5578/14104838381_1afea7139b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Water feature" class="img-responsive"><em>Water feature</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were lots of beautifully decorated court yards, and some huge green
gardens outside, but rain that day impeded me from exploring the external parts
of the palace very much.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14085111856/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Metropol Parasol by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5509/14085111856_b380ca185e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Metropol Parasol" class="img-responsive"><em>Metropol Parasol</em></a></span></p>

<p>In the evening I went and explored one of the stranger, modern attractions of
Seville: The Metropol Parasol. It&#8217;s a huge wooden structure, several stories
high, apparently the largest wooden structure in the world. It looks kind of
like those <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wood+dinosaur+kit&amp;tbm=isch">wooden dinosaur
kits</a> you&#8217;d beg for
at museums when you were a kid (or was that just me?), except instead of a
dinosaur they got some crazy mushroom looking thing.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921571459/in/set-72157644463351646" title="On top of the Metropol Parasol by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5465/13921571459_b78a62036f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="On top of the Metropol Parasol" class="img-responsive"><em>On top of the Metropol Parasol</em></a></span></p>

<p>At night it&#8217;s all lit up with coloured lights and looks pretty funky. You can
pay a few euro to get up on top of it and walk around the path, there&#8217;s even a
few bars up there and you get a free drink with your admission!</p>

<p>My next and final stop in Spain was in Málaga. It wasn&#8217;t a place I&#8217;d ever really
even heard of before, but I was flying out from there so I thought I&#8217;d give it
a look.</p>

<p>The hostel I stayed in had a thing running that night where you could help their
cook make paella and then get to eat it afterwards, although it ended up move
like watching the cook make it while getting to meet some other people in the
hostel: Annika, a German girl studying in Spain, Joni, a Finland guy on
holidays, and another guy from Finland who&#8217;s name I didn&#8217;t get, but who was
shit-faced drunk, quite rude, and kept mentioning how he had an alcohol problem.</p>

<p>Those of us who weren&#8217;t complete alcoholics went out for a few drinks (the
irony) after dinner and ended up in a pub trivia competition after meeting up
with a friend of Annika&#8217;s named Lilia and her brother Thomas. I don&#8217;t remember
how we went at trivia, almost certainly not well, but it was a really fun
evening out.</p>

<p>When I got back to the hostel I found another girl who was staying in my dorm
standing sort of awkwardly outside the door. Apparently the raging alcoholic was
asleep in someone else&#8217;s bed, as he&#8217;d wet his own bed and the one below it, and
quite rightly she didn&#8217;t want to be in there alone with him. The fun people you
meet in hostels! We went down to reception to see would could be done and they
very apologetically sorted us out and moved us into another room.</p>

<p>The next morning I went on yet another free walking tour which was given by an
Australian girl Natalie. It happened to be her birthday it was and it was her
first time giving a tour, so her sisters Vanessa and Shelly who were visiting
from London got us all to sing her happy birthday at the end of the tour.</p>

<p>The tour was good, went around Málaga and showed us the sites, although I was
probably a bit more interested in socialising. After not really meeting anyone
in Seville or Cordoba so it was nice to have some people to talk with.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921701700/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Wine from the barrel by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2910/13921701700_236ca21f56_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wine from the barrel" class="img-responsive"><em>Wine from the barrel</em></a></span></p>

<p>The tour visited this little tiny bar where you buy a glass of wine, straight
from the barrel. They had white wines and reds, sweet and dry; what I tried was
pretty good stuff.</p>

<p>We also went into a market full of tasty delis, with all the olives a person
could want, unless they didn&#8217;t like olives in which case it would probably be
too many.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14128412563/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Catherdral with an unfinished tower by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7367/14128412563_57bd5ffc50_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Catherdral with an unfinished tower" class="img-responsive"><em>Catherdral with an unfinished tower</em></a></span></p>

<p>We stopped under this cathedral which was supposed to be symmetrical but they
ran out of money and never finished it, so it has only one completed tower. I
think it&#8217;s a bit more interesting this way anyway.</p>

<p>My afternoon consisted of a tapas lunch and a few beers with the Aussie girls
from the tour, then practicing spinning poi in a park for a while before going
home and having a nap. Then I went out for dinner with Annika and another girl
she&#8217;d met, Iva from Canada, at a little seafood place near the port, before
meeting up with Lilla and Thomas again for some €0.40 beers.  It&#8217;s a hard life
being a traveller sometimes. :P</p>

<p>On Sunday I made a long walk up the hill to visit the Castle of Gibralfaro,
which was thankfully mostly shaded. I arrived just after 2pm, and conveniently
for me it happened to be free after 2pm on Sundays so I got in for nothing. The
castle was pretty peaceful, and you were able to walk around the tops of many of
the walls and have a nice view over the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14105274272/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Castle wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2919/14105274272_68dd815cb4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Castle wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Castle wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>The square-ish bits at the top of the wall were topped by triangles (check out
that terminology, they don&#8217;t call me a castle-ologist for no reason!), which
someone told me is something to Moors would do to make Roman walls their more
Moorish or something.</p>

<p>The very last thing I did before leaving Spain was to hack off my 6-7 months of
beard growth off. It just felt like it was time to show the world I still had a
face under all that hair.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14105307192/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Ridiculous handlebars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7179/14105307192_6f4f4ed294_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Ridiculous handlebars" class="img-responsive"><em>Ridiculous handlebars</em></a></span></p>

<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t cut it all off right away :P I&#8217;d been working on growing out
a handlebar moustache from the beard for a few weeks and thought I&#8217;d let it
stand on it&#8217;s own for a little while, as a bit of a laugh for the friends who I
was going to spend Christmas with. I still get a smile looking at this photo,
thinking about just how over the top it is! It really felt like I was wearing a
fake moustache disguise when I first cut it back to this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>From Barcelona I caught the overnight train to Granada. It left fairly late in the
evening and arrived in Granada at about 9am the next morning. I had some sleeping
pills and slept as well as is possible on a train, but was still exhausted when
I arrived.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916722755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2900/13916722755_b4e79f4e47_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada" class="img-responsive"><em>The courtyard at my hostel in Granada</em></a></span></p>

<p>I headed straight to a hostel that I&#8217;d looked up online beforehand and checked
that they had a bed for me. It was too early to check in but they let me lock up
my bags in their storage room and allowed me to take advantage of their
breakfast buffet.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Over breakfast I got talking with a friendly girl named Emily from Adelaide, who
convinced me to go on a free walking tour with her and her other Adelaidian friend
Connor.</p>

<p>The tour was led by a nice guy named Borja, a student who&#8217;d been living in
Granada for some time. I also met some other friendly faces on the tour, Rachael
from Chicago, and Jack from Hobart.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893631012/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Inside the Hamam by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3758/13893631012_de64238da4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Inside an old Hamam (bath-house)" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside an old Hamam (bath-house)</em></a></span></p>

<p>The tour gave us a bit of an orientation of the old part of the city, and filled
us in on a bit of the history of the city. Granada had been held by the Moors
for quite a long period of time, which is why there&#8217;s a lot of Moorish style
architecture around the city.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I learn was about the trouble that UNESCO causes for the
home owners in Granada who can&#8217;t afford to maintain their houses to the level
that UNESCO requires. This lead to huge fines and eventually having to give up
their houses to UNESCO. Apparently there is a huge proportion of abandoned
properties in the old city caused by this. It&#8217;s troublesome to think about, you
want these places looked after, but it seems cruel and wasteful to force the
owners out because they can&#8217;t afford the maintenance.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893651602/in/set-72157644104270734" title="A random courtyard our waking tour wandered into by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2933/13893651602_63856101f6_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="A random courtyard our waking tour wandered into" class="img-responsive"><em>A random courtyard our waking tour wandered into</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s quite a large number of cave house on the hill above Granada. Some of
them have been there so long that the people living in them have been given land
rights, while others are considered illegal dwellings and the police
occasionally come by and evict lots of the people.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917231884/in/set-72157644104270734" title="This are apparently the original cave homes, they dont look very cave like anymore by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3680/13917231884_f6cf9e3973_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="This are apparently the original cave homes, they dont look very cave like anymore" class="img-responsive"><em>This are apparently the original cave homes, they dont look very cave like anymore</em></a></span></p>

<p>Borja told us he that he&#8217;d spent some time living in a cave house at one point,
looking after it for a friend, and told us what a friendly communal vibe the
older area of caves had.</p>

<p>He also let slip that Granada gets a bit lonely for young people because it&#8217;s
such a student town.  Nobody stays for very long. Students come, they study and
then they leave so you only ever know people for a few years maximum.</p>

<p>After the tour finished up, just about everyone on the tour went and had lunch
at a tapas place, where the lunch special was €2 for a beer and your choice of 3
tapas from their huge buffet. Quite a bargain! We all organised to meet up
again later in the evening to see a gig put on by a band that Borja played in.</p>

<p>The 2-3 beers, and my tiredness from not getting good rest on the overnight train,
meant that I spent my afternoon back at the hostel and slept for a few hours.</p>

<p>When I woke up I found Em and Connor down in the common area and we headed to
the bar where the band was to play. The streets are pretty narrow and winding,
I&#8217;m sure I would never have found the place if it weren&#8217;t for Connor&#8217;s superb
navigation skills.</p>

<p>The Venue was tiny! The table in the corner we initially sat down at turned out
to double as a makeshift stage, so we shifted back a little to give the band
some room. The place felt jam packed too, although Borja later told us it gets
busier than that.  I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;d fit the people.</p>

<p>Just about everywhere in Granada does some form of tapas with your drinks. At
this place they would ask you how many drinks you&#8217;d had each time you ordered
another, and based on the number there was a certain sequence of little
delicious snacks that you&#8217;d get to accompany your beverage.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916878053/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Live music in a tiny little bar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7152/13916878053_e23947d397_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Live music in a tiny little bar" class="img-responsive"><em>Live music in a tiny little bar</em></a></span></p>

<p>The band was great, lots of good covers, and there was a nice informal feel to
things. Rachael even broke out into song at one point, and can that girl sing!
If being a chef gets old, she&#8217;s got potential to make a living from that voice.</p>

<p>The next morning I ran into Em and Connor again at breakfast and we decided to
go up to the Alhambra together. On the walk there I managed to fall up a tiny
set of two stairs, and sprained my left ring finger. ouch! :(</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916827755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Connor &amp; Emily at the path to the Alhambra by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3816/13916827755_4ca281df1f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Connor &amp; Emily at the path to the Alhambra" class="img-responsive"><em>Connor &amp; Emily at the path to the Alhambra</em></a></span></p>

<p>We had all heard stories about how you needed to book days in advance, but we
just turned up and got lucky. We were allocated a timeslot to enter the palace
pretty much right away, so we dashed past the rest of the Alhambra grounds and
headed straight there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917389114/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Columns and carvings by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2928/13917389114_da6a381b04_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Columns and carvings" class="img-responsive"><em>Columns and carvings</em></a></span></p>

<p>The palace was full of incredibly intricate carvings, in many place the carvings
went from the floor to the ceiling. It is hard to imagine how long it would have
taken to carve it all out with so much detail.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893897796/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Rich colours by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3749/13893897796_085e34aa23_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rich colours" class="img-responsive"><em>Rich colours</em></a></span></p>

<p>A few parts had been restored (several hundred years ago IIRC) and still had some
paint remaining. It would have been mind blowing to see the place fully painted
back in the time it was used as a palace.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893863532/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Leave no surface uncarved by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7028/13893863532_392ee084ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Leave no surface uncarved" class="img-responsive"><em>Leave no surface uncarved</em></a></span></p>

<p>I learned about an interesting restoration technique from one of the info
boards, where they embed the new material used in restoration with a UV reactive
substance, so it appears plain to the naked eye but can still be obvious which
parts are truly original to the historians studying the structure.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916961855/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Beautiful patterns by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7353/13916961855_f16db6cb33_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beautiful patterns" class="img-responsive"><em>Beautiful patterns</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went through the palace at a very slow pace, and at some point Rachael had
arrived and caught up with me, and the other two had moved through much quicker
and finished well before us, so it was lucky that we&#8217;d organised to meet up
somewhere later on if we got separated.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893925392/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Round courtyard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2928/13893925392_1a7b0067cf_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Round courtyard" class="img-responsive"><em>Round courtyard</em></a></span></p>

<p>Rachael and I ended up exploring the rest of the Alhambra grounds together. We
found this huge square building that had a circular open courtyard in the
middle, and now housed some museums and art galleries that we did an obligatory
quick pass through.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917101303/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The view towards the new city by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7222/13917101303_643cec571e_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The view towards the new city" class="img-responsive"><em>The view towards the new city</em></a></span></p>

<p>We climbed up the towers next to the barracks, which gave a great view out to
the city of Granada, and an interesting aerial view of the foundations of the
barracks.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917480704/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Soldiers barracks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7295/13917480704_933abe24e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Soldiers barracks" class="img-responsive"><em>Soldiers barracks</em></a></span></p>

<p>The time I&#8217;d organised to reconvene with Connor and Emily was quickly
approaching, so it was very convenient when we ran into them again up on top of
one of the towers, and agreed to scrap that plan and organised something else.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893944911/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Waterjets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7235/13893944911_34bb93d54d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterjets" class="img-responsive"><em>Waterjets</em></a></span></p>

<p>The last part of the complex we visited was the Generalife gardens, which
featured a lot of beautiful fountains and water gardens.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893979231/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Water Stairway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7133/13893979231_d013b17942_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The Water Stairway" class="img-responsive"><em>The Water Stairway</em></a></span></p>

<p>On the little map/booklet about the Alhambra it made special mention of a
water-staircase, so Rachael and I got it into out heads it would be something
quite impressive to behold. Instead it turned out to be a pretty plain old
staircase with a little channel of water running down the hand-rail of either
side, be we made up a story about how it must of at least be special royal
water, not the regular peasant stuff they give to everyone else.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917089765/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Garden fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2932/13917089765_9f4cbb3592_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Garden fountain" class="img-responsive"><em>Garden fountain</em></a></span></p>

<p>All the walking around the Alhambra had made us a bit hungry so we sought out
somewhere to have a few beers and the free tapas they&#8217;d come with. We passed by
a lot of places that seemed a little too fancy to offer a good beer and tapas
deal, and eventually found a cute little place called Boabdil. It was a small
place down a little alleyway, off another alleyway with very utilitarian decor.
Stainless steel benches, fixed stools and bain-maries full of food. It turned out
to be a great choice, with really tasty food and the drinks were only €1.70!</p>

<p>We got a message from Em and Connor and let them know where we were, so we could
regroup and head the fountain, meeting place of the afternoon walking tour to
the caves on the hill that we wanted to do. It turned out it was being led again
by Borja, a lovely surprise. Jack was also back for more, and had apparently
been up to the Alhambra that day as well, although we somehow never crossed
paths.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917536504/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The illegal cave homes on the hill by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7366/13917536504_2e47accf22_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The illegal cave homes on the hill" class="img-responsive"><em>The illegal cave homes on the hill</em></a></span></p>

<p>The cave tour took us up the hill behind the old city, past a few nice view
points of the Alhambra and the old city itself with the sun setting behind it.
Then eventually up among the (illegal) hippy caves, of which only a few of who
have electricity via solar panels. I was surprised to find that even these caves
were a lot more established than I had been expecting when I first heard &#8220;cave

<p>We went right up the top where a church (I think?) with a nice wall to sit on was built,
where we could sit and watch the sun set.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894015226/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7402/13894015226_a458e0d9de_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>After the sun had set we walked down the back side of the hill, via the newer,
less established area of caves. We learned that there&#8217;s an old hippy dude way
further over in the hills who&#8217;s lived there for years and runs a little tetería
there, a possible excursion for another day.</p>

<p>After tour ended the group went on a little tapas crawl to various bars, in the
interest of getting a good feed and a few drinks into us. The first place served
us awesome Spanish ham, with legs of ham hung up all around the place. The
second gave us delicious cheese and more ham, so tasty that we stayed for a few
rounds.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894038541/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Flamenco show by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7389/13894038541_a0f16743cd_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Flamenco show" class="img-responsive"><em>Flamenco show</em></a></span></p>

<p>Next stop was a flamenco show at a little cave venue, for the princely sum of
€6. It was worth seeing for the sake of saying you&#8217;d done it, but it wasn&#8217;t
really something I&#8217;d seek out again. The dancing is enthusiastic but this time
around I found the singing kind of whiny and not all that enjoyable, and the
little cave/basement it was in was pretty dark and dingy.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894058432/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Lovely gardens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7074/13894058432_536c27a832_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lovely gardens" class="img-responsive"><em>Lovely gardens</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next day I went up to explore the gardens just below the Alhambra with Em,
Connor and Rachael. They were lovely and peaceful, and very well manicured.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894089151/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Having tea at Ishmael's cave teter&#xED;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7279/13894089151_0dac8cbf10_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Having tea at Ishmael's cave teter&#xED;a" class="img-responsive"><em>Having tea at Ishmael&#8217;s cave teter&#xED;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>After we&#8217;d finished exploring there, we decided to go and try and find the
tetería we&#8217;d been told about the evening before, run by the old hippy dude
Ismael. After stopping to ask the locals which path to take a few times we
managed to find our way around the hill to to tetería which had a stunning view.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894101056/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Fanciest tea + tapas ever! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7273/13894101056_828b2b23a1_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Fanciest tea + tapas ever!" class="img-responsive"><em>Fanciest tea + tapas ever!</em></a></span></p>

<p>We each had a tea which came out beautifully presented, each with it&#8217;s own tasty
fruit tapas sitting on top! Easily the fanciest tea I&#8217;ve ever had!</p>

<p>In the evening Em and Connor had to go and meet up with someone who was giving
them a lift to Seville, but Rachael and I went to try and find Nuestro Bar, a
place that a friend who lived here for a while had told me about that was
supposed to have really great tapas.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917211833/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Alhambra at night by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3706/13917211833_b89bf08c6d_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The Alhambra at night" class="img-responsive"><em>The Alhambra at night</em></a></span></p>

<p>After walking for what seemed like forever we found the place. It seemed like an
ideal hangout for students (and backpackers!) on a tight budget. The drink
prices were very cheap and the tapas consisted of fried food in fairly large
serves, even if it was lacking a little in the quality department.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894138352/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Jewish district by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2909/13894138352_ae5d9cbba3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The Jewish district" class="img-responsive"><em>The Jewish district</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next morning I went exploring the old city with Rachael. We started in the
Jewish district, which had many cobblestone paths featuring the star of David.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894162272/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Cobblestone artwork by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7176/13894162272_0f3cbee403_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Cobblestone artwork" class="img-responsive"><em>Cobblestone artwork</em></a></span></p>

<p>The surrounding area had lots of very ornate cobblestone paths in lots of
different patterns.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894176706/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Street art Owl in Granada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7052/13894176706_bbd2e3d2a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Street art Owl in Granada" class="img-responsive"><em>Street art Owl in Granada</em></a></span></p>

<p>We explored around an area that our little tourist map told us was full of
street art and found quite a few very nice pieces.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894207302/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Bicycle powered merry-go-round by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7409/13894207302_8c4727d226_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Bicycle powered merry-go-round" class="img-responsive"><em>Bicycle powered merry-go-round</em></a></span></p>

<p>We ventured past a Christmas market at which it seemed like all of the
children&#8217;s rides were human powered, for example this merry-go-round was turned
by a guy peddling a bicycle that was attached. Not sure if they&#8217;re doing it to
save money on a motor, or to be environmentally friendly, but it seemed pretty
cool to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917758144/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Freaky street performer in front of a church by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3733/13917758144_ca2e006565_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Freaky street performer in front of a church" class="img-responsive"><em>Freaky street performer in front of a church</em></a></span></p>

<p>We passed by the Cathedral and saw this very freaky looking street performer
doing a &#8220;living statue&#8221; thing, which I stealthily took a photo of under the
guise of taking a picture of the church. When we got to close to the cathedral
some old gypsy ladies swarmed us, trying to give us rosemary, shouting stuff at
us in Spanish. I didn&#8217;t want a bar of it but Rachael initially accepted their
rosemary before she realised they wanted money from her, and afterwards decided
that all the shouting they did at her was probably them putting a curse on her.</p>

<p>At lunchtime we sought out a place serving Alhambra brand beer (I seem to have
failed to note what the common beer was in my notes, but it was some other
beer), and we found a great tapas place that gave us bacon wrapped cheese rolls,
prawns, chorizo, and delicious spicy salty squid. I&#8217;m salivating just thinking
about them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894696952/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Band jamming by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5030/13894696952_83c956412f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Band jamming" class="img-responsive"><em>Band jamming</em></a></span></p>

<p>We decided to spend the afternoon doing a short hike we&#8217;d heard about that ran
along the other side of the river, and on out way there we happened to pass some
buskers that included the singer dude from the band a few nights earlier.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13918252094/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Kings and knights patrolling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7073/13918252094_7952020765_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Kings and knights patrolling" class="img-responsive"><em>Kings and knights patrolling</em></a></span></p>

<p>Then a King and a bunch of knights happened to wander past us. Just your average
afternoon in Granada!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894721682/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Looking back towards Granada and the hill of cave homes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2935/13894721682_474a0e52c5_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Looking back towards Granada and the hill of cave homes" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking back towards Granada and the hill of cave homes</em></a></span></p>

<p>We eventually made it to the other side of the river, and followed the path
along to quite a nice view of the caves, and found some more caves on the other
side of the river too. Caves everywhere!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894193162/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Caracol by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2939/13894193162_206b181be6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Caracol" class="img-responsive"><em>Caracol</em></a></span></p>

<p>Rachael and I went and tracked down a restaurant we passed on the walking tour
the first day that served snails. Rachael, being a chef, wanted to see how the
Spanish served them, and I&#8217;m always eager to try strange foods. We did manage to
find it, but it was disappointingly closed.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894756511/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Tapas menu by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3694/13894756511_c3bbfc3231_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Tapas menu" class="img-responsive"><em>Tapas menu</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;d looked up a list of best tapas places in Granada and we went to one called
Babel tapas bar, which claimed to serve world fusion food. The food was great but
the service was pretty poor. It took use nearly two hours to get two drinks each
and tapas. I happened to take a photo of the menu to give you an idea of the
sorts of stuff you get to pick from when you&#8217;re buying a beer in one of these
places. I wish I&#8217;d thought to take more photos of stuff like this, and the tapas
itself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894758262/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Giant bowl of snails by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3732/13894758262_17d7c170de_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Giant bowl of snails" class="img-responsive"><em>Giant bowl of snails</em></a></span></p>

<p>We ended up going back to the cheap and tiny place from the previous day, in which
the very cheerful bartender was quick to serve us drinks and delicious tapas.
We saw they offered snails as a non-tapas dish, so we ordered a serve to try
them. What came out what a giant bowl full of snails, probably 40+ of them. I
though they had a kind of odd texture and weren&#8217;t anything to write home about.
I think I prefer the French style ones where you only get a few and they&#8217;re
drowned in butter and garlic.</p>

<p>We finished up the night at a place called Los Diamontes a seafood tapas place
which had rave reviews.  Unfortunately I think we must have gone to the wrong
one (there seems to be two with the same name in Granada). We got a serve of
regular sized prawns, shells and all :/ It was very noisy, all hard surfaces and
no music or anything to help with that. It felt like being in a shopping centre
food court except without the muzak. We decided to call it a night after that.</p>

<p>My last day in Granada I went out to have a look at some of the clothing shops
around the old city. There was lots of awesome hippy-style clothes, all of which
would fit in at the Rainbow Serpent market but very little of which actually
looked like designs I&#8217;d seen at Rainbow Serpent. I checked the tags on a few
things and most of it seems to be made in Nepal. Seems like it would be a good
place to go on a shopping trip.</p>

<p>Leaving Granada I tried using a ride sharing website I&#8217;d just learnt about
called Blablacar. I organised to get a lift to Cordoba, my next stop, with a guy
who was living in Granada on the weekends and working in Cordoba during the
week. He drove a fairly flash 2 door BMW, which was actually kind of cramped
with 4 people in it, but all in all it was a good experience. Seems like the
future of hitchhiking to me.</p>

    <id>http://www.lucasthenomad.com/2014/05/13/happy-travel-birthday-to-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/first-birthday-cake.jpg" alt="birthday cake" class="img-responsive" /></span></p>

<p>So today marks my first travel birthday. One year ago today I boarded my first
flight of this trip, leaving my home in Melbourne and headed out to see the
world. Actually, because time zones are always a pain in the ass, it was
actually more like 1 year and 16 hours or something but one year rolls of the
tongue better. It&#8217;s the longest period I&#8217;ve ever been away from Australia by at
least a few months now.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>In that time I&#8217;ve visited heaps of crazy places, done a lot of amazing things,
met numerous of amazing people, and learnt that keeping a blog up to date is
near impossible for me. Even keeping a blog running 4-6 months behind real-time
requires a whole lot more time that I expected. Having that lag actually feels
like a good thing, because it allows me to revisit periods of time and remind
myself of things I had already forgotten, which in turn, helps keep me motivated
to continue working on the blog so I&#8217;ll have something to look back on when I&#8217;m
old and my memory is even worse. That, and because my mum and Amanda like it :P</p>

<p>How do I feel after a year on the road?</p>

<p>I miss home. I miss having a home. I miss my friends and family back home a lot,
even if I&#8217;m terrible at mentioning it and equally as bad at keeping in touch.
I&#8217;m even missing working, which is great as overcoming the burnt out feelings I
was having towards work was one things I really hoped to get out of this trip.</p>

<p>When am I coming home?</p>

<p>After reading the last paragraph you&#8217;d probably be thinking &#8220;soon,&#8221; but that&#8217;s
not the case. Being able to travelling for this long, with this much freedom,
required putting a lot of things on the line: Moving out of the best share house
I&#8217;ve ever lived in, quitting the best job I&#8217;ve ever had (even if I was burning
out), and putting nearly every one of my friendships on hold, hoping that people
will forgive me the negligence when I return.</p>

<p>Given how much energy I invested into making this my reality, I want to push this
as far as I can. There&#8217;s still countless things to see, do or experience (plenty
of which I probably don&#8217;t even know about today) and I&#8217;m going try and keep
seeing, doing and experiencing things while I can.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not actually sure what else to write about here, maybe this is already more
than is necessary, but if you have any questions you&#8217;d like to ask, fire away!
:)</p>

      <p>Even in winter the weather is Barcelona is lovely. As soon as I landed and got
through customs, I put my heavy winter jacket away and was quite comfortable in
just a T-shirt. It seemed like the warm weather would be great for helping me
kick a cold that had been hanging around for my last few weeks in Berlin, which
had left me sniffing and congested for far too long.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809549773/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Sagrada Familia by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3669/13809549773_b5c9a73fbe_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="La Sagrada Familia" class="img-responsive"><em>La Sagrada Familia</em></a></span></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I spent the first few days not doing very much, walking around the city near La
Rambla and enjoying the warmth, and trying to rest up.</p>

<p>Once I was feeling a bit better I took a free walking tour of Barcelona that
went around a number of sites in the heart of Barcelona and gave some background
and history about the city. The tour really made me realise how little I know
about Spanish history, even the quite recent parts. I did not know that they had
had a dictatorship right up until the mid-70s, which was apparently allowed by
the rest of Europe because their dictator hadn&#8217;t supported Hitler in WWII.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807882714/in/set-72157643866689355" title="First glimpse of Caga Tio, the shitting log by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2840/13807882714_d5216a705b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="First glimpse of Caga Tio" class="img-responsive"><em>First glimpse of Caga Tio</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also learnt about some rather unique Catalan Christmas traditions. The first
being Caga Tio (Literal translation: Uncle Shit), a log with a smiling face and
a blanket. Each day leading up to Christmas the kids beat Caga Tio with sticks
&#8220;to help with digestion&#8221;. Then on Christmas day, if the kids have beaten him
enough to help him with his digestion problems, they peer under Caga Tio&#8217;s
blanket and find that he&#8217;s pooped out a load of candy. An important life lesson
to teach your kids!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810536113/in/set-72157643866689355" title="So many caganers by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7126/13810536113_62c182214f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="So many caganers" class="img-responsive"><em>So many caganers</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another strange Catalan Christmas tradition is the caganer. The caganer is a
little man, squatted over with his arse hanging out of his pants, and on the
ground behind him is a freshly made turd. He&#8217;s apparently hidden somewhere in
every good Catalan person&#8217;s nativity scene, and the kids love to search for him.
There was stall after stall selling these caganers, which you can get in the
likeness of all kinds of celebrities, the most distasteful being Nelson Mandela
the very same week he died. The guide said the caganer had something to do with
the idea of giving back to the earth, but it just seems like they&#8217;re obsessed
with poop to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807913783/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Nathalie, Ibrahim and me by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7309/13807913783_34a18f23dc_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Nathalie, Ibrahim and me" class="img-responsive"><em>Nathalie, Ibrahim and me</em></a></span></p>

<p>One evening I arranged to meet up with one of my old Envato workmates Ibrahim,
and his beautiful wife Nathalie, to go and eat at a really nice tapas place they
had told me about.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807896004/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Tapas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7013/13807896004_9b77c7e756_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Awsome tapas" class="img-responsive"><em>Awsome tapas</em></a></span></p>

<p>The place did not disappoint, everything we tried was delicious from the Spanish
ham and croquettes to the not-so-traditional perfectly cooked little steak
bites, with delightful sangria to wash it all down. I think my stand-out
favourite was the little sandwiches with
<a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/sobrasada_de_bellota.jpg">sobrasada</a> (basically spreadable chorizo) and
melted cheese. Spreadable meat seems like it should be a bit wrong, but it tasted
fantastic. I&#8217;m told that when <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/sturicho.jpg">sturicho</a> was visiting he
loved the stuff too; Ibby said he probably would have brushed his teeth with the
stuff if he could have :P</p>

<p>It was great to see Ibrahim and Nathalie again, they&#8217;re both such kind
hospitable people. It&#8217;s always a pleasure spending time with them and I look
forward to (hopefully) being able to converse in Spanish with them the next time
we meet.</p>

<p>I managed to get along to see Güell palace, a building that was once the home of
the Güell family, and which had been closed for renovations the last time I was
in Barcelona.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808355844/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Parabolic arches by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7302/13808355844_14212b2d48_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Parabolic arches" class="img-responsive"><em>Parabolic arches</em></a></span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s another very beautiful building designed by Gaudí, designed with lots of
smooth curves and vibrant colour. Gaudí used a lot of parabolic arches and other
unique geometry in his designs which give both strength as well as visually
interesting features to the building.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808807974/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Wrought iron work by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3801/13808807974_c1b85cb2b3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Wrought iron work" class="img-responsive"><em>Wrought iron work</em></a></span></p>

<p>It featured a lot of quite complex wrought iron work which must have been made
by very skilled craftsmen. It was all so neat and regular, it&#8217;s hard to believe
it wasn&#8217;t done by a machine.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808579334/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Palau G&#xFC;ell chimneys by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3819/13808579334_34846ded2c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Palau G&#xFC;ell chimneys" class="img-responsive"><em>Palau G&#xFC;ell chimneys</em></a></span></p>

<p>Up on the roof there were heaps of colourful chimneys, no two the same. Many
were decorated with lots of tiny bits of broken tile, a style heavily used by
Gaudí in a lot of his works, but there were also a few that were just red bricks
built in interesting formations.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808511193/in/set-72157643866689355" title="The bullring shopping center by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3830/13808511193_4e985a5e60_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The bullring shopping center" class="img-responsive"><em>The bullring shopping center</em></a></span></p>

<p>I made a visit  to Plaza de España to go up to the roof of Arenas de Barcelona,
an old bullring that has since been converted into a shopping centre. There&#8217;s a
lift out the front that you have to pay a few Euro to get up to the viewing
platform on the roof, or you can go inside the shopping centre and use the
escalators and get up there for free.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808520673/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Looking out from the rooftop, straight at a hotel pool by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3684/13808520673_8e1f63c67c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Looking out from the rooftop, straight at a hotel pool" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking out from the rooftop, straight at a hotel pool</em></a></span></p>

<p>From the roof you get a nice view of the city in most directions. You also get a
view looking straight at a hotel&#8217;s swimming pool. I imagine it was built long
before the viewing platform was there, but I can&#8217;t imaging people rushing to use
the pool now with hoards of people at Arenas looking straight out at you.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808555395/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Montju&#xEF;c Castle by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5504/13808555395_c2fe7003c2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Montju&#xEF;c Castle" class="img-responsive"><em>Montju&#xEF;c Castle</em></a></span></p>

<p>From there I got a bus to Montjuïc Castle and explore. I remember visiting here
the last time I was in town, and the building seemed mostly how I remembered it,
although I&#8217;m pretty sure it wasn&#8217;t free last time and now it is :D</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808612155/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Barcelona by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7004/13808612155_755dbcd073_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="Barcelona" class="img-responsive"><em>Barcelona</em></a></span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s up on top of a hill, so it&#8217;s another great place to get a view of Barcelona.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to see a light/water/sound show known as &#8220;The Magic
Fountain&#8221;. When I arrived there was an absolutely massive crowd and the show
seemed to be delayed. Nobody seemed to have much of an idea what was going on so
I ducked off for a quick drink, then from where I was having my drink I saw a
huge fireworks show going off from the direction of the fountain. It wouldn&#8217;t
have seemed out of place on the TV amongst a wrap-up of the years NYE fireworks,
it was really epic. I found out later that this was just for some couples wedding&#8230;
rich people!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808981964/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Magic fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2909/13808981964_21e85ea3b0_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Magic fountain" class="img-responsive"><em>Magic fountain</em></a></span></p>

<p>Anyway, I went back to the fountain and found that now that the fireworks were
over they were back to a more normal schedule for the fountain. I took a seat
and watched the wonderfully synchronised display. Some of the water effects were
really foamy, and light and fluffy looking, and the lights coming through made it look like some
sort of magic smoke. Really cool to see.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810906184/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell Logo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5321/13810906184_e7aab18a47_c.jpg" width="800" height="504" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell Logo" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell Logo</em></a></span></p>

<p>On a day that happened to be another public holiday I tried to go to Sagrada
Familia, but the queue went right around the block. I wasn&#8217;t really keen on
waiting for hours to get in and have the place be cramped full of people so I
went to Park Güell instead.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809086694/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell main stairway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7090/13809086694_ec3de27f4a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell main stairway" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell main stairway</em></a></span></p>

<p>Sadly the public holiday meant even though I didn&#8217;t have to wait long to get in,
the park was packed to the rafters with people and felt like a circus. Nothing
like the peaceful, attractive park I had such nice memories of.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808713993/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Spiral pillars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7230/13808713993_668bf0eec4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Spiral pillars" class="img-responsive"><em>Spiral pillars</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was really challenging to get a nice photo of any of the signature parts of
the park without a dozen people also in the shot posing for their next Facebook
avatar. I did manage to get a few shots that might mislead you into thinking it
wasn&#8217;t like that at all, but that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;m both stubborn and patient
and will wait around for 10+ minutes waiting for that tiny gap.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809144934/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell dragon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2866/13809144934_9a03d34057_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell dragon" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell dragon</em></a></span></p>

<p>The most well known part of the park, the dragon, was a nightmare. There was an
endless line of people waiting to rush in for their photo, myself included. I
did manage to get one nice shot of it by itself, but the photos with me in them
all had photobombers in the background.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809190964/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7395/13809190964_2a5f3c5741_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ended up leaving feeling a bit sick (the cold was still hanging around),
frustrated and generally fed up with large crowds. I probably should have just
rested on the public holidays and gone the next day.</p>

<p>I noticed that there was a couch surfing meet up happening at a little flamenco
concert at a bar on the other side of town, so I headed over to check it out. I
met a bunch of lovely South Americans there who all lived in Barcelona now. It
was nice to hear some Spanish that I knew was actually Spanish for a change, all
the Catalan that&#8217;s spoken in Barcelona is really off-putting for a Spanish
learner.</p>

<p>The flamenco show had beautifully played guitar and singing, and some <em>very</em>
passionate dancing. I had a &#8220;front row&#8221; seat, which meant the woman dancing was
often facing right towards me, barely 2ft away, which did make me feel quite
uncomfortable and self-conscious. My brain is weird sometimes.</p>

<p>One of the couch surfers was a nice girl from Chile, Natalia, who insists that I
get in touch with her where I go to Chile or Uruguay, so she can put me in touch
with her friends there to maybe stay with them. Win!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809497833/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Casa Batll&#xF3; Fa&#xE7;ade by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3806/13809497833_e3fbede624_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Casa Batll&#xF3; Fa&#xE7;ade" class="img-responsive"><em>Casa Batll&#xF3; Fa&#xE7;ade</em></a></span></p>

<p>Next up went and had a look at Casa Batlló, another home designed by Gaudí.
A lot of parts of the place have a bit of a dragon theme to them, with lots of scales
and bone-like features on the façade and several more within.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809039093/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Whirlpool ceiling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7357/13809039093_b7955d4fc3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Whirlpool ceiling" class="img-responsive"><em>Whirlpool ceiling</em></a></span></p>

<p>This room had a very unique ceiling that spiralled around to look like a
whirlpool vortex, with curved walls, curved doors&#8230; pretty much curved
everything.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809204735/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Casa Batll&#xF3; by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2832/13809204735_0f45c216f5_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Casa Batll&#xF3;" class="img-responsive"><em>Casa Batll&#xF3;</em></a></span></p>

<p>The internal stairwell is tiled with blue tiles, but with darker tiles at the
top, slowly fading to lighter blue tiles at the bottom. This was done to
compensate for the colours being washed out by the bright light of the skylight
when looking up, so it would appear a uniform blue, and it worked pretty well at
doing so.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809366973/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Casa Batll&#xF3; rooftop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7117/13809366973_f627feefd8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Casa Batll&#xF3; rooftop" class="img-responsive"><em>Casa Batll&#xF3; rooftop</em></a></span></p>

<p>Up on the rooftop there were more zany chimneys, decorated with the broken tile
style. I don&#8217;t know why every fireplace needs it&#8217;s own separate chimney at the
very top, but it makes them look interesting at least.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809385475/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Dragon scale tiles by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7401/13809385475_22543ea05a_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Dragon scale tiles" class="img-responsive"><em>Dragon scale tiles</em></a></span></p>

<p>The roof tiles used on the very top of the façade really look like scales, with
the ridge of the roof looking kind of like a colourful spine. Yet another
building that would have been so cool to actually live in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810183203/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Epic lighting by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7222/13810183203_d87235eb86_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Epic lighting inside La Sagrada Familia" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic lighting inside La Sagrada Familia</em></a></span></p>

<p>I returned to La Sagrada Familia and this time the lines were far more
reasonable and I got in in about 20 minutes. This was one of my favourite
buildings the last time I came to Spain and it still is today. It&#8217;s probably my
single favourite building anywhere in the world. A big call, but it&#8217;s one heck
of an impressive structure.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810039463/in/set-72157643866689355" title="The passion fa&#xE7;ade by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3750/13810039463_727a96e8f0_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The passion fa&#xE7;ade" class="img-responsive"><em>The passion fa&#xE7;ade</em></a></span></p>

<p>The building has been under construction for around 130 years now, with
information in the museum estimating it will be completed in 2030, so I may even
live to see it finished. My favourite side of the building last time was &#8220;The
Passion&#8221; façade, which this time unfortunately was partially covered in
scaffolding. The sculpture style is very angular and not really attempting to
look really human, which I feel makes it far more interesting than the generic
style that seems to dominate sculpture.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810295075/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Model of the completed Sagrada Familia by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7096/13810295075_f30b748621_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Model of the completed Sagrada Familia" class="img-responsive"><em>Model of the completed Sagrada Familia</em></a></span></p>

<p>I found this model and learnt that even though the building is already huge, the
5 or 6 tallest towers are not built yet. The central &#8220;Jesus&#8221; tower alone is
going to be nearly double the height of any of the existing ones. Epic!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810099654/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Inside a tower through the doorway arch by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2895/13810099654_fd5569be9d_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Inside a tower through the doorway arch" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside a tower through the doorway arch</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got to go up inside one of the Nativity towers, which thankfully they have an
elevator to take you up. You get a good view of the city, some interesting
angles on the construction that&#8217;s taking place, and some eery long drops to look
down the middle of spiral staircases.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809927463/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Spiral! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7249/13809927463_026c86c61a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Spiral!" class="img-responsive"><em>Spiral!</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was a lot of steps down from the tower, in a rather tight and dizzying
spiral, but it&#8217;s way better walking down steps than up them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810315284/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Stunning lighting in the afternoon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7340/13810315284_70ee143cc7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Stunning lighting in the afternoon" class="img-responsive"><em>Stunning lighting in the afternoon</em></a></span></p>

<p>The time of day, and the intense brightness of the suns, meant that the stained
glass was casting lots of wonderfully pretty light inside the building. There
are still large area where the windows are just plain glass, so I can only
imagine the rainbow this place will be when all the windows are done.</p>

<p>I just love all the clean complexity of all the shapes involved, with so much of
it coming from fairly simple math and geometry concepts. The columns for example
are <a href="http://www.sagradafamilia.cat/sf-eng/docs_instit/geometria1.php">double
twisted</a>,
meaning that they have twice as many &#8220;sides&#8221; at their tops than they
do at the bottom, and there&#8217;s no sudden point where this shape change takes
place. There was a video of the machine they used to produce them and it was
mesmerizing to watch. <a href="http://www.sagradafamilia.cat/sf-eng/docs_instit/geometria1.php">The whole geometry
section</a> of the
official site is worth checking out if you like that kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810328804/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Rainbow pillars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2919/13810328804_7ac1795f11_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Rainbow pillars" class="img-responsive"><em>Rainbow pillars</em></a></span></p>

<p>That was in the very interesting museum underneath that I don&#8217;t recall from
last time. There was lots of information about the design, including a replica
of the hanging model of the building, made from string and sandbag weights,
which was used to work out the correct angles for everything to bear the weight.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started to wonder what my photos from last time I visited looked like, and
if I had enough foresight to take photos of both the completed and under
construction parts of the building to compare. This time I made sure I took some
photos of the construction, which while not particularly interesting now, will
be great to look back on in 20 years and seeing this massive structure still
heavily in progress.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810745704/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Crazy rainbow building by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3706/13810745704_f46a278fb5_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Crazy rainbow building" class="img-responsive"><em>Crazy rainbow building</em></a></span></p>

<p>The last thing of note I checked out was this strange egg shaped building called
Torre Agbar. At night the building is a slowly changing cloud of colours. It&#8217;s
quite impressive to see a 30+ story building semi-randomly changing colours in
the darkness.</p>

      <p>One very cold a miserable morning I went to see Sachsenhausen concentration
camp, out at Oranienburg. The camp was about a two kilometre walk from the
station in literally freezing cold mist.</p>

<p>This camp had been used by the Nazis during the war, but also used by the
Russians around 1945-50 after the war ended, who continued to the use the camp
to kill those who opposed the Russian control of East Germany after the war.
There was lots of info about individual prisoners accounts and that sort of
thing, but it was all just small fragments so I left without a very good picture
of what things were like during that later period.</p>

<p>The foundations of the buildings containing the gas chambers and the oven were
all that is left of that structure. The building also contained the neck-shot
room, in which they would tell the prisoners they were going to measure their
height against a tape measure on the wall, but then a person in the adjoining
room would fire a shot through a slit in the wall straight into their neck,
killing them. The Nazis were not nice people at all.</p>

<p>The exhibition in the infirmary had mention of there being a brothel on site,
where some females prisoners were forced to work, being raped by soldiers and
selected prisoners as a means of rewarding them. Really messed up stuff.</p>

<p>It was cold enough the day I was there that most water on the ground had frozen
solid, and the misty rain that started again as the sun was setting was
unpleasantly cold, but strangely appropriate for the setting. It really helped
imagine how hard it would have been being a new prisoner arriving in the winter,
being given only summer clothes and made to stand out in the yard for 24 hours,
not being allowed to move. I&#8217;m not surprised by how many died on their first
night there.</p>

<p>After leaving the camp I walked past a gluhwein seller not far down the road
who was an absolute lifesaver. There&#8217;s nothing like a hot, alcoholic beverage to
warm your chilled bones.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I had to move out from the Nicoles place as they had
a friend coming to stay for Thanksgiving. I was sad to be leaving, they&#8217;re both
really lovely people. They made me feel right at home while I was there with
them, so welcoming and friendly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576145783/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2835/13576145783_14b4d46382_c.jpg" width="765" height="800" alt="Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort</em></a></span></p>

<p>Random fact about Nicole and Nicole is they like tea, and own enough of it to build a
tea-fort.</p>

<p>I moved to a hostel which had great reviews online, but turned out was almost
solely inhabited by very blokey Australian guys, aside from the one staff member
there who was English I think and very camp. I felt pretty out of place to put
it nicely.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574866713/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Beate Uhse Erotic Museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5278/13574866713_2ab2331733_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beate Uhse Erotic Museum" class="img-responsive"><em>Beate Uhse Erotic Museum</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went and had a look at an erotic museum, part of the oldest sex shop in the
world: Beate Uhse. It seemed like there was a lot of potential to have been a
very interesting museum but I found the place sort of dull. One of the two
floors was almost solely about the woman who owned it, and the other floor was
full of drawings and things that you could have told me were kitsch holiday
souvenirs and I wouldn&#8217;t have blinked.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576132425/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Nicole and Nicole are lovely people by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3798/13576132425_d19510e3d9_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Nicole and Nicole are lovely people" class="img-responsive"><em>Nicole and Nicole are lovely people</em></a></span></p>

<p>Having only just left the Nicoles place, I was invited back the next night to
take part in their Thanksgivukah celebrations, combining Thanksgiving and
Hanukkah. My first exposure to either holiday :D The food  was delicious, mostly
vegetarian or vegan, and the deserts were sickeningly sweet!  It was nice to
meet some of their friends, one of whom was an Australian girl who was also born
in Wagga Wagga (the amusingly named town I was born in), and also moved away at
a very young age. What are the odds?</p>

<p>I got a message from Harmen that he was back in Berlin again so we met up and
visited the DDR museum, a museum about how things were in East Germany during
the communist era. It was a great exhibition, but it&#8217;s crying out for a bigger
space. The exhibition is overflowing with so much stuff to show that half of it
is hidden behind little flaps you open or in drawers that you pull out, which
isn&#8217;t really compatible with having the place so packed full of people that
there&#8217;s no room to open the exhibitions. Hopefully the popularity will lead to
them thinking about a bigger venue.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574951913/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Me in a Trabant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7361/13574951913_4fec5217ce_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me in a Trabant" class="img-responsive"><em>Me in a Trabant</em></a></span></p>

<p>One really neat thing there was the recreation of the inside of an East
German apartment, complete with hidden bugs that you could listen to from
another room in the museum.</p>

<p>After the museum we went to to a brew pub called Brew Baker, that I&#8217;d been told
had an amazing pumpkin ale on a special brew, a style of beer that I&#8217;d never
tried before. The pumpkin ale was alright, but the IPA and a super sweet dark
beer they also had were my favourites. It was located inside a really nice
looking little indoor market.</p>

<p>It was around this time I went and spent a day exploring Spreepark, an old
abandoned theme park in a pretty derelict state that I <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/2013/12/05/spreepark-Berlin">blogged about earlier
here</a>. Just recently I
saw <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/berlin-just-bought-abandoned-theme-park-180950287/">this
article</a>
saying that the city of Berlin has now bought the park, so I may have gotten in
just in time to see it before it gets redeveloped into something else.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575101705/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Charlottenburg Palace by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3828/13575101705_f688cbbd87_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Charlottenburg Palace" class="img-responsive"><em>Charlottenburg Palace</em></a></span></p>

<p>One morning I tried to go and see Schloss Charlottenburg, a huge palace now used
as a museum, but I didn&#8217;t think about the fact it was Monday so the building was
closed. I did get to explore the gardens though, which were really beautiful.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575266765/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Charlottenburg Palace gardens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7113/13575266765_a2c54864c0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Charlottenburg Palace gardens" class="img-responsive"><em>Charlottenburg Palace gardens</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was a lovely light frosting on the certain parts of the very neatly
manicured garden which gave a lovely effect.</p>

<p>I spent my last few evenings in Berlin venturing around to various Christmas
markets. At home I&#8217;ve felt jaded about Christmas for many years, but there was
something about Christmas in Berlin that got through to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575685933/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Christmas Markets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7378/13575685933_404c26c7ae_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets" class="img-responsive"><em>Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets</em></a></span></p>

<p>For once it didn&#8217;t feel like a giant event organised by big companies to sell
more shit you don&#8217;t really need. There was great food, tasty beverages, rides
and amusements and most importantly there were jolly people having a good time.
This is quite a contrast that to my image of Christmas back home: overcrowded
shopping malls full of grumpy people who don&#8217;t want to be there, and it&#8217;s easy
to see why I prefer the way Berlin does it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576063984/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Gluhwein! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7368/13576063984_d6d4128944_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Gluhwein!" class="img-responsive"><em>Gluhwein!</em></a></span></p>

<p>The first market I went to explore was the huge one set up near Alexanderplatz,
which was kind of like a big show in a country town. There were loads of places
selling gluhwein; you could get the regular stuff, optionally with a shot of
spirits or schnapps, or eierpunsch, which is yellow and creamy like eggnog,
super sweet and with whipped cream on top. They even had gluhbier, spiced beer
served warm that was rich and a little sweet. Naturally I had to try all of
them. Some of them more than once.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576186964/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Christmas Markets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3694/13576186964_b29f3390fb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets" class="img-responsive"><em>Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets</em></a></span></p>

<p>I had some tasty shredded pork stuff for dinner, and a bag of &#8220;donut hole&#8221; type
things for desert, and boy did I feel sick afterwards from eating all that sweet
stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576273754/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Bergstra&#xDF;e, the last street still cut off by the Berlin wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3730/13576273754_865530b401_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Bergstra&#xDF;e, the last street still cut off by the Berlin wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Bergstra&#xDF;e, the last street still cut off by the Berlin wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent my last day  at the Berlin Wall memorial. There are fragments of the
multiple layers of wall, and there is a street that the wall still crosses
which is the last street still cut off by the wall today.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576371664/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Deadzone through a crack in the wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7348/13576371664_0933a8fc86_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Deadzone through a crack in the wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Deadzone through a crack in the wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a section that has been rebuilt to have both complete walls, a
guard tower and lights, giving you a much better feeling how it would have
really felt to be trapped in East Germany during the Soviet era.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576109973/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Wall reconstuction as seen from the viewing platform by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3819/13576109973_71720c6006_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wall reconstuction as seen from the viewing platform" class="img-responsive"><em>Wall reconstuction as seen from the viewing platform</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a viewing tower built nearby so you can get a more elevated view of
the whole thing.</p>

<p>There were some interesting stories about buildings that were right along the
border, that had doors opening both into East and West Berlin, allowing the
owners access to both sides. Eventually the West German side was bricked up to
stop people escaping via these houses, then the people were evicted, and finally
the buildings were torn down.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576059895/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Bernauer Stra&#xDF;e by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7390/13576059895_af1afc3e82_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Bernauer Stra&#xDF;e Station" class="img-responsive"><em>Bernauer Stra&#xDF;e Station</em></a></span></p>

<p>West Berlin also had the underground train network, parts of which passed
through under East Berlin city centre, but to stop people escaping through the
metro tunnels the stations in East Berlin were bricked up and abandoned.
Bernauer Straße station was one such station, but you wouldn&#8217;t know it today.</p>

<p>I snuck in an amazing last lunch at a nice little place not far from the heart
of the city, and ate this amazingly good pork knuckle. The meat was so tender it
just fell apart; I could have eaten it with just a fork.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13787696054" title="Amazing pork knuckle, the meat was so very tender by Lucas Parry, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3766/13787696054_4316f8a490_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Amazing pork knuckle, the meat was so very tender" class="img-responsive"><em>Amazing pork knuckle, the meat was so very tender</em></a></span></p>

<p>My bill came and it was mysteriously discounted by 20%, and I was so happy with
the meal I tipped the 20% right back to them. :D</p>

<p>My last night in Berlin I hit a few more of the more traditional style Christmas
markets at PrenzlauerBerg and Charlottenburg. These ones were far less fun-park
like and had even more variety in food and handicrafts.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576227415/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Swinging Barbecue by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7397/13576227415_9b6456df0d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Swinging Barbecue at PrenzlauerBerg" class="img-responsive"><em>Swinging Barbecue at PrenzlauerBerg</em></a></span></p>

<p>PrenzlauerBerg had a strong showing of Swedish and Finnish stalls with their own
takes on Gluhwein.  There was also some huge BBQs where the grill was suspended
by chains above the coals, slowly swinging and turning. I&#8217;m not sure if it had a
functional purpose but it looked cool!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576305803/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3798/13576305803_c78197835f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market" class="img-responsive"><em>Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market</em></a></span></p>

<p>The Charlottenburg markets were out the front of Charlottenburg Palace, with
lots and lots of food places. I had myself an epic roast dinner, then a huge
Hungarian donut thing before stumbling home to my hostel to get ready for my
flight the next morning to Spain.</p>

      <p>I did a huge amount of exploration around Berlin appreciating the street art,
probably at least 4-5 days whole days worth in total if you added it all up. I
did a few &#8220;self guided&#8221; walking tours (as in I had an itinerary or stuff to look
for that I found somewhere online), A ton of randomly wandering after spotting a
cool piece by chance, and a &#8220;Real Berlin&#8221; free walking tour that turned out to
be quite heavily street art focused.</p>

<p>On one of my many aimless explorations I stumbled upon some buskers playing in
the street who were drawing quite a crowd.  A band called <a href="http://www.thetroublenotes.com/">The Trouble
Notes</a>. One guy planing an electric violin, one
guy finger picking the heck out of a guitar while also using it as a percussion
instrument, and another dude sitting on a unique drum that was just kind of a
square box. They had a very beautiful sound and were so damn good I stopped and
listened to them for probably an hour.  I even bought a CD to support them, even
though I have nothing to play it in. I also got a flyer for a show later in the
month in a very obscure warehouse venue.</p>

<p>I moved in to the Nicoles&#8217; place on the day of a &#8220;crafternoon&#8221; that was still in
progress when I arrived. I hung out and tried to make an origami animal that had
been stumping everyone all afternoon (damned if I can remember what the animal
was now, a whale maybe?), but we struggled with it for a very long time before
discovering there were instruction in the front of the book explaining the
meaning of all the different fold-arrows.  With this Nicole A was finally able
to successfully make the animal! I thought only men didn&#8217;t read instructions,
but now I know better :P</p>

<p>I spent an entire day exploring the street art around Warschauer Straße Station,
in and amongst the converted warehouse along Revaler Straße. This area oozes
creativity, with nearly every surface being covered in colourful murals and most
of the people around there looked like the sorts of folk my dad would look at
disapprovingly as dirty hippies. My kind of people! :)</p>

<p>I walked along the nearby East Side Gallery, a 1.3km long section of the Berlin
Wall that is now used as an open air art gallery. There over 100 painting, all
of them enormous. There was also a whole row of Trabants, the car of East Germany,
parked along the side the wall.</p>

<p>I walked the whole length of the wall and then along some of the backside as
well and was lucky enough to come upon a bunch of artists spending their Sunday
afternoon painting the back of the wall and having a few beers. Art in progress
:D</p>

<p>Another day I went on a &#8220;Real Berlin Walking Tour&#8221;, as recommended by another
friend who lived in Berlin briefly and highly recommended it. The tour had a
strong focus on graffiti and street art, which I didn&#8217;t know about beforehand
and meant we went to several places I&#8217;d already checked out. It was great to
have a knowledgeable guide there to point specific artists works and styles, and
then start recognising their stuff all around the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565480803/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Garbage Elephant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7131/13565480803_2d4637d7f0_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Garbage Elephant by a crew who make art from stuff they find on the street" class="img-responsive"><em>Garbage Elephant by a crew who make art from stuff they find on the street</em></a></span></p>

<p>It seemed like our guide must have been well connected in with the street art
community based on how much he seemed to know about individual artists,
techniques, etc. I almost suspect he may have actually been one of the artists,
although he denied it when I asked him directly.</p>

<p>On the tour I learned some more about the Berlin wall and the Cold War. One
interesting titbit I picked up was that West Berlin was the only part of West
Germany that didn&#8217;t have conscription, which led to many of the liberals
migrating there, which could very well explain the very liberal culture that
exists there today.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565231714/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7038/13565231714_49c68617c3_c.jpg" width="800" height="391" alt="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river" class="img-responsive"><em>Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also learned how property developers have been permitted to start developing
along the lovely green strip behind the long strip of wall that makes up the
East Side Gallery. What a complete fuck up! I thought that the one building that
was in progress was a horribly inconvenient eye sore, meaning you could no
longer walk along the full length of both sides of the wall. To find out they&#8217;re
now planning on building along most of that strip, including a section currently
occupied by an African Youth support centre who are being evicted, is terrible.
Wikipedia even tells me they&#8217;re going to knock down extensive segments of the
gallery.</p>

<p>Another day I visited the Deutsches Technikmuseum, the German Museum of
Technology. I love science and technology museums as a rule, although this one
had such a heavy focus on trains and planes that you could be forgiven for
thinking it was just a transport museum.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568945104/in/set-72157643245435323" title="This musuem had a crazy number of planes in it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2807/13568945104_6685df757b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="This musuem had so many planes they needed to mount this one vertically" class="img-responsive"><em>This musuem had so many planes they needed to mount this one vertically</em></a></span></p>

<p>I especially liked this jet engine that was opened up so I could poke my head
right inside and get an idea of what the insides of one of those things looks
like and how the &#8220;reverse thrust&#8221; thing planes do to stop actually works. I&#8217;ve
since tried to look out the window on a flight as we landed to try see this in
action but the wing gets in the way. :(</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568499815/in/set-72157643245435323" title='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr'><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7408/13568499815_3175e0b7e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position' class="img-responsive"><em>Jet engine, the back is open in the &#8220;braking&#8221; position</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were some other smaller sections about old bicycles, medicine,
photography, old mechanical computers and televisions.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13567596055/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Wooden bike by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7077/13567596055_f5671ee900_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wooden bike, totally hipster" class="img-responsive"><em>Wooden bike, totally hipster</em></a></span></p>

<p>Some of the old televisions had Cathode Ray tubes so long that they would
orient them with the screen facing the ceiling, and then use a 45º mirror to
flip the image so a sitting viewer could watch it. To think today there are
2+ metre televisions that are only a few cm thick&#8230; The progress of technology
is awesome!</p>

<p>There was also a historical brewery, complete with shiny copper mash &amp; lauter tun
and boiler.</p>

<p>One evening while I was still staying with the two Nicoles, I went and saw The
Trouble Notes do a live show, with the two of them and a friend of theirs. The
venue was an old building hidden down a very dark alley, surrounded by building
that felt like they were largely abandoned. It felt like the kind of place you
went down to get stabbed, but it turned out fine for us. The Trouble Notes put on
very good show, even if the support act was a bit too emo and the venue was
super smoky.  It really feels like I got in a time machine and went back 20
years to be back in a place where you can smoke in public venues.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of days exploring the various museums on the Museum Island.
First up was the Pergamon museum, which has in it&#8217;s collection a giant
Babylonian gate, and an ancient temple plundered from turkey.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570513833/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Pergamon Altar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7315/13570513833_b093193675_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pergamon Altar" class="img-responsive"><em>Pergamon Altar</em></a></span></p>

<p>I read up and learnt that the Babylonian gate on display is actually the
smaller, rear-side of the entrance way. The front must have been absolutely
epic!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570336943/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Ishtar Gate by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7338/13570336943_508a1c623f_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Ishtar Gate" class="img-responsive"><em>Ishtar Gate</em></a></span></p>

<p>The New Museum was great, I found the building itself to be very interesting,
with each room styled differently and quite uniquely. Much of it has been
reconstructed since the war. It&#8217;s funny, the place felt way too old to be
calling it &#8220;the new museum&#8221;.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570806863/in/set-72157643245435323" title="More plundered loot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2816/13570806863_91ff2f0594_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="More plundered loot in the New Museum" class="img-responsive"><em>More plundered loot in the New Museum</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also went to the Old Museum which looks really majestic from the outside, but
I felt the inside of the building lacked any real character and was rather dull
and sterile.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570964433/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The old museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3675/13570964433_e1959ec409_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The old museum" class="img-responsive"><em>The old museum</em></a></span></p>

<p>One morning I booked in to visit the Reichstag Building (the German Parliament),
a building with an impressive glass dome on top of it, which you can go up for a
nice view. It&#8217;s free but you have to book online in advance.</p>

<p>Surprise track work meant that I was pretty late, I&#8217;d left home cutting things
pretty fine according to Google maps estimations, but then there were no trains
running on the line I needed to change to, so I had to go to another station on
a different line, then practically run to try and get there near the time I was
scheduled to, all the while being mobbed by supposedly deaf street collectors.</p>

<p>The collectors hand you a card with a little statement in a bunch of languages
asking you to sign their clipboard (petition? I cant remember), then if you
don&#8217;t read that clipboard you suddenly find you&#8217;ve signed up to make a donation.
Call me a cynic, but those deaf collectors look just like the gypsies in every
other city in Europe.  I suspect they&#8217;ve just come up with a new way of
extracting money from people without having to know a word of any language in
particular.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13571856715/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Reichstag Building by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3747/13571856715_cd8f850ee4_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Reichstag Building" class="img-responsive"><em>Reichstag Building</em></a></span></p>

<p>Anyway, the Reichstag was a very impressive building, the inside of the dome
contains a system of mirrors which collect and reflect light down into the
parliament, lessening the need for artificial lighting. Really clever stuff.</p>

<p>There was a ramp spiralling up around the dome, with an audio guide that is
automatically activated as you walk around, giving you a nice (but hard to
photograph) view of the city in all directions.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13569107935/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Checkpoint Charlie looks like a tourist trap on the street by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7038/13569107935_690ccf05dc_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Checkpoint Charlie looks like a tourist trap on the street" class="img-responsive"><em>Checkpoint Charlie looks like a tourist trap on the street</em></a></span></p>

<p>One place I had hesitations about visiting the was Checkpoint Charlie Museum,
because the street outside makes the whole area feel like an awful tourist trap.
Inside it turned out to be nothing of the sort and was way better than I
expected.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13782271403" title="Wall of passports by Lucas Parry, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7118/13782271403_70cfe1090f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Wall of passports inside Checkpoint Charlie" class="img-responsive"><em>Wall of passports inside Checkpoint Charlie</em></a></span></p>

<p>It contained lots of interesting stories about the many successful and
unsuccessful attempts to escape from East Germany to flee to the west.  There
were stories about escapes hidden in the modified car engine bays, secret
compartments in large welding machines, one woman who hid in a pair of connected
suitcases side by side on the luggage rack of a train, hot air balloons,
gliders, even some attempts in homemade submarines in the Baltic sea. The museum
was actually quite large, but I think the layout means a lot of people miss half
of it. I pretty much had the place to myself in that section.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>Once I&#8217;d gotten into Berlin and checked into my hostel I got in contact with my
friend Erin, an American who I met in South Africa who lives in Berlin on a
semi-regular basis. We arranged to meet up for dinner and she offered to give me
an introductory tour of the city. It was pretty lucky timing as Erin was leaving
Berlin for a month just a few days after I arrived.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575837835/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Alexanderplatz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7329/13575837835_b631a6aafb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alexanderplatz S-Bahn Station" class="img-responsive"><em>Alexanderplatz S-Bahn Station</em></a></span></p>

<p>We  walked all around the city, past the museum island, Potsdamer Platz,
Brandenburger Tor, The Jewish Memorial, and loads of other sites around the
city. It was quite the whirlwind introduction to the city, we even visited a
small Christmas market that was up and runing very early and got to have some
gluhwein! Delicious spiced wine served hot, perfect for the cold nights leading
up to Christmas. It was lovely to see Erin again and it felt like a really nice
way to get to know the city being shown around by someone who obviously loves
the place.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I feel a bit bad about having zero photos with Erin or the places we went to go
with this part of the post, but at times while travelling I&#8217;ve been hit by
&#8220;photo sorting fatigue&#8221;, which leaves me in a state where I think to myself &#8220;if
I don&#8217;t take any photos I wont have to sort them!&#8221;, which leads to gaps like
we have here.</p>

<p>We met up again the next day to go and visit Tempelhof Park, an old airfield
that has been turned into a public park, but still has all the runways and stuff
there. It&#8217;s kind of surreal to be wandering around on what quite obviously was
once an immense airfield, with people jogging past or cycling on bikes.  These
days there&#8217;s a community garden there and areas dedicated for having BBQs and
stuff.  It seems like it would be a lovely place to spend some afternoons at in
the summertime, and would make a stellar venue for a music festival.</p>

<p>We went out and ate pizza that night with Erin&#8217;s housemates, Nicole and Nicole,
as a chance to meet each other and see how we got along, and to see about the
possibility of me moving into Erin&#8217;s room while she was away. The two Nicoles
were both lovely and I thought it would be neat to live in a typical German
apartment for at least some of my stay in Berlin. They were happy to have me
take the room, so I got to move in a few days after Erin left.</p>

<p>In my last few days staying in the hostel I met a Dutch guy named Harmen who was
a bit of a history buff and seemed like a nice fellow, so we decided to explore
some of the city together. We went to the Holocaust Museum, which was very
interesting but there was just too much information there to process it all, so
by 3/4 of the way through I was skipping reading 90% of the text and was pretty
well museum-fatigued.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525055773/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7312/13525055773_8cd2455173_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe" class="img-responsive"><em>Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</em></a></span></p>

<p>To combat that we went into a nearby bar for a rest and a few beers. We got talking
with the bartender, a girl from Birmingham named Carley, who gave us some good
tips for some neighbourhoods to go exploring later in the evening.</p>

<p>After we felt able to tackle another museum we headed to the Topography of
Terror museum, which is built right next to the foundations of the headquarters
of the Secret State Police, the SS and the Reich Security Main Office of the
Third Reich.  Its also coincidentally right next to a long segment of the Berlin
wall that was still in original condition and position, complete with some large
holes smashed in the concrete presumably during the reunification.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525750244/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Hole smashed in a preserved part of the Berlin Wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3785/13525750244_66e9ee1851_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Hole smashed in a preserved part of the Berlin Wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Hole smashed in a preserved part of the Berlin Wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was great having Harmen there to fill in the massive gaps in my knowledge
about German history. I remember we covered the World Wars in high school, but I
don&#8217;t think we ever even touched on the Cold War (I guess because Australia
played no part in it, and our history classes seemed to have been very biased
towards things that Australia took part in, rather than important events that
shaped the world as it is today.</p>

<p>I never really enjoyed history at school, but I now looking back I think that
was largely because of the incredibly narrow focus that my small rural high
school had in its classes.  The stuff I&#8217;ve learned about while travelling about
the history in a bunch of other countries has been fascinating. Far more
interesting than hearing about Australians being slaughtered at Gallipoli for
the hundredth time.</p>

<p>The Topography of Terror museum was another really good museum, covering the
various groups involved in carrying out the atrocities of WWII. It focused a lot
more on the &#8220;who&#8221; and what they did. There were some very interesting
perspectives there, but again too much information to take it all in in only one
visit.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525606303/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Spaceman by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3799/13525606303_19c05ecd34_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Spaceman near Kottbusser" class="img-responsive"><em>Spaceman near Kottbusser</em></a></span></p>

<p>Harmen and I then went to Kottbusser Tor, the suburb recommended to us by Carley
earlier in the day, and found that although it seemed like an interesting suburb
with a lot of cool street art, there seemed to be nothing but Turkish
Restaurants around. If you&#8217;ve read my post about Turkey, you&#8217;ll know I adore
Turkish food, but being newly in Germany we were really wanting to try some
German food and it honestly felt a bit disheartening that a single culture had
so completely squeezed out all others in the food scene in this part of the
city.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m would think there&#8217;s a saturation point for number of kebab shops you really
need on any one street, and I&#8217;m pretty sure the streets of Kottbusser tor
crossed that point long ago.</p>

<p>We ended up caving in and getting Turkish food since there seemed like there was
no other option, and it was quite frankly disappointing. Overpriced and dry,
leaving me even more confused how such an average restaurant can survive in the
face of so much competition?</p>

<p>After dinner we went to a nearby tapas bar for a while to soak in the
bohemian/hipster vibe they had going on there, before heading over the bridge
near Warschauer Straße station into a district of old warehouses that had been
converted into bars, skate parks, climbing centres and all kinds stuff, all very
decorated on the outside with loads and loads of awesome graffiti.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13562682523/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Mural by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7022/13562682523_baf9b0ce7d_c.jpg" width="800" height="396" alt="One of the many murals" class="img-responsive"><em>One of the many murals</em></a></span></p>

<p>We found a nice little bar in what seemed to be a bit of a multi-purpose
building. At various times I saw through different open doors and I&#8217;m sure I saw
2-3 different bars, a room that looked to be some sort of music recording
studio, and what I think might have been a juggling studio up stairs. Quite an
eclectic mix.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525867974/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Hipster folk music by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7017/13525867974_09174cf869_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hipster folk music hoedown" class="img-responsive"><em>Hipster folk music hoedown</em></a></span></p>

<p>They had some live music happening in the bar, initially a single guy
alternating between playing a pan flute and a ukulele, then more musicians
little crank at one end, and the original guy switched over to playing something
that appeared to be a bag pipe, but with inoffensive tuning. For serious, a bag
pipe without the piercing pitch, it actually sounded pleasant! Then two of them
started doing some folk dancing. It was quite the cool little show. Brunswick
hipsters, eat your heart out.</p>

<p>Another day I went an walked along Karl-Marx Allee, a monumental boulevard built by
the GDR/DDR, I guess to try and show off how great communism is. It is lined
with lots of massive buildings built during the early years of the Cold War.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13526156075/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Towering East Berlin buildings on Karl-Marx Allee by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3755/13526156075_e9e5c61fe9_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Towering East Berlin buildings on Karl-Marx Allee" class="img-responsive"><em>Towering East Berlin buildings on Karl-Marx Allee</em></a></span></p>

<p>There are some interesting communist advertising on top of a few buildings.
Interesting because being communist meant there wasn&#8217;t really a need for any
advertising since there was no competition between companies, but there were ads
for stuff in West Berlin and didn&#8217;t want to be outdone by them.</p>

<p>There was also a small model of Sputnik on top of a cafe, because space
exploration&#8230; or something.</p>

<p>But the highlight for me, completely unrelated to it&#8217;s socialist past, was the
epic video game museum. It contained pretty much every console imaginable and
loads of classic games, and a number of classic arcade machines too. The place
brought out a tremendous amount of nostalgia in me, so many fond memories from
younger years.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13538254253/in/set-72157643245435323" title="So much video game history by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3771/13538254253_f0fd2c472a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So much video game history" class="img-responsive"><em>So much video game history</em></a></span></p>

<p>Some pieces of note included the original Sega Master System, my first
ever console,</p>

<p>A virtual reality machine that I have memories of paying way too much to have a
turn of at a video game arcade somewhere in Queensland when I was a kid,</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13528085255/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The first VR machine I ever saw and used back when I was a kid by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3756/13528085255_3da8f04e72_c.jpg" width="645" height="800" alt="The first VR machine I ever saw and used back when I was a kid" class="img-responsive"><em>The first VR machine I ever saw and used back when I was a kid</em></a></span></p>

<p>And this very unique arcade machine called the PainStation, which was a multi
player game that physically electrocuted, burnt and whipped the players while
they played a video game, and whoever flinched away first lost.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13536673074/in/set-72157643245435323">Seriously</a>.
Sadly it wasn&#8217;t switched on so I can&#8217;t say how bad the pain really was.</p>

      <p>Flying into Manchester from Athens, the first thing that struck me about
England was just how lusciously green everything was. Yes, I&#8217;ve been to England
before, I even lived there for nearly a year some time ago, but I was still
blown away by it. No other country I&#8217;ve been to has rolling fields and hills like
England.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842850784/in/set-72157641676939995" title="The green fields of England by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3703/12842850784_5691109e42_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The green fields of England" class="img-responsive"><em>The green fields of England</em></a></span></p>

<p>After landing in Manchester I got the train to Nottingham and went and met up
with my old friend Matty P at his local pub, the Vat and Fiddle. A few years had
passed since Matt left Australia so it was fantastic to catch up with him and
try a few pints of Castle Rock&#8217;s fine ale selection. We made a quick trip to
Matt&#8217;s house to dump my bags then headed to Brewdog to try a few more UK ales
before heading back to Matty&#8217;s place for the nights rest.</p>

<p>The next morning we sought out a proper, full English breakfast from a local
cafe; bacon and eggs, sausages, mushrooms and baked beans. So
damn good! Only thing missing was black pudding, but we dealt with that
omission at subsequent breakfasts.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842520403/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Real English Breakfast by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7302/12842520403_d7bb632171_c.jpg" width="709" height="800" alt="Real English Breakfast" class="img-responsive"><em>Real English Breakfast</em></a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast we headed up to Nottingham castle for the event that drew me to
England at this time, <a href="http://www.beerfestival.nottinghamcamra.org/">The Robin Hood Beer
Festival</a>. It&#8217;s a &#8220;real ale&#8221;
festival run by <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/">CAMRA</a>, offering over 1,100 casks of
ale to sample, and about 300 ciders for those with no taste (Sorry Amanda
:P). They had 900 casks of ale tapped at any one time, with the others
&#8220;settling&#8221; so that when they&#8217;re tapped they pour clear instead of being cloudy
with too much yeast.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842527873/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Me and Robin Hood by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3723/12842527873_578178e15c_c.jpg" width="800" height="571" alt="Me and Robin Hood" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and Robin Hood</em></a></span></p>

<p>On arrival you&#8217;re given a bunch of tokens, two of which buys a third of a pint
of ale. The best part is that you don&#8217;t have to spend any tokens to try an ale!
The people working there want you to find a beer you like before you commit to
drinking a third of it, and so will let you taste any of the beers for free.
The volume of these tastes would often be more than you&#8217;d get at a beer tasting
event back in Australia, and there you&#8217;d have to be spending tokens for the
privilege. England has beer tasting all figured out!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842551603/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Me and Matt at the Robin Hood Beer Festival by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7354/12842551603_ed49d9bbc1_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Me and Matt at the Robin Hood Beer Festival" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and Matt at the Robin Hood Beer Festival</em></a></span></p>

<p>The people working serving the beers seemed pretty knowledgeable, and had a
surprisingly good balance of the genders. Still weighted towards males, but
there were a lot of ladies serving too. The people working were mostly
unaffiliated with any particular brewery, and were just beer lovers
volunteering.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842468605/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Casks of ale by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3667/12842468605_11aedb31da_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Casks of ale" class="img-responsive"><em>Casks of ale</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was an amazing variety food available there too. I ate a zebra burger from
a place with all sorts of wild game meat (wild boar, kangaroo, etc.). More
varieties of exotic meat than at Carnivore in Kenya! I think England&#8217;s
reputation for bland, boring food is well out of date these days.</p>

<p>Not long after lunch Amanda and Luke arrived and met up with us at the festival,
it was great to see them again, and to taste beers and discuss them with Luke.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842600093/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Amanda and Luke looking uncertain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3686/12842600093_1e26711dc4_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Amanda and Luke looking uncertain" class="img-responsive"><em>Amanda and Luke looking uncertain</em></a></span></p>

<p>I worked it out afterwards, and I think I only drank about 6 pints over the
whole day there (8-10 hours of well paced drinking), but I got to try dozens of
different ales. So much better than the 1-2 hour tastings where you&#8217;re rushing
everything so you don&#8217;t run out of time. I think it also helped keep things
relaxed knowing that trying everything was impossible. I&#8217;d done the sums
and worked out that even just a 30ml shot of each beer would have meant drinking
over 30 litres. Australians like to drink, but even we aren&#8217;t that stupid.</p>

<p>We left the festival in the early evening and made a stop in at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Olde_Trip_To_Jerusalem">Ye Old Trip To
Jerusalem</a>, one of
several pubs that claims to be the oldest in the UK. They claim to have been
serving beer there since 1189AD. The pub is partly carved out of a sandstone
cave, giving it a cosy atmosphere. It&#8217;s mind-blowing to think that people have
been drinking at that same venue for almost 1000 years.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842631413/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Everyone is surprised by just how old this pub is by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7392/12842631413_e3c00a92ed_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Everyone is surprised by just how old this pub is" class="img-responsive"><em>Everyone is surprised by just how old this pub is</em></a></span></p>

<p>Our last stop for the night was at The Canalhouse, a little craft beer focused
pub along the canals, which actually has a section off the canal that runs in
through the pub.  Presumably it was for unloading casks of ale back in the days
(and maybe even still today?).  There we had a few strong craft beers (some
well over 9% ABV), which didn&#8217;t help with the way we woke up feeling
the next morning. In case you can&#8217;t guess, it wasn&#8217;t fantastic.</p>

<p>Once we were up and going the next day, we made a visit to the op shops in the
rich part of town. I managed to score a good winter jacket for £8 and a dapper
hat for £6.50. Travelling without winter clothes worked out great for me this
time, and hopefully will again if I end up somewhere cold again in the future.</p>

<p>We did some scenic driving and had a nice long lunch at The Unicorn Hotel, a
traditional style country pub, where the Pedigree ale pie was fantastic.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842642093/in/set-72157641676939995" title="The Unicorn Hotel by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3691/12842642093_892b269298_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The Unicorn Hotel" class="img-responsive"><em>The Unicorn Hotel</em></a></span></p>

<p>On Saturday we went back to the beer festival for it&#8217;s biggest day. We didn&#8217;t
have pre-bought tickets so we got there before the gates opened to try and
ensure we&#8217;d get in. There we found a line of people winding way down the hill
and around the corner, all the while with England giving us some of its best
weather. In other words, it pissed down with rain.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842696893/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Massive line in the rain to get into the beer festival on Saturday morning by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7352/12842696893_ed76d09210_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Massive line in the rain to get into the beer festival on Saturday morning" class="img-responsive"><em>Massive line in the rain to get into the beer festival on Saturday morning</em></a></span></p>

<p>Once the gates opened the line moved quite fast (although it continued to grow
about as fast as it moved), but we all got in without much hassle.</p>

<p>We went straight to the table area and secured ourselves a table and then I got
some chicken tikka masala for breakfast. It is not sensible drinking without a
bit of &#8220;ballast&#8221; in our stomachs as Matty P liked to put it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12843079154/in/set-72157641676939995" title="10am drinks, the right way to start Saturday! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2863/12843079154_c01659c684_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="10am drinks, the right way to start Saturday!" class="img-responsive"><em>10am drinks, the right way to start Saturday!</em></a></span></p>

<p>This time we focused on the top tent where our table was, which conveniently had
the most different ales available. There was also a bottom tent, and then a few
other &#8220;renegade&#8221; tents with only one or two breweries beers available in them
two. It turns out you need a fair bit of space for 1100 casks of beer!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842759953/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Even more casks today by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2883/12842759953_136d0e8363_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Even more casks today" class="img-responsive"><em>Even more casks today</em></a></span></p>

<p>My favourite beer of the festival was <a href="http://www.bateman.co.uk/our+brewery/our+beers/speciality+cask+beers">Bateman&#8217;s Hazelnut
Brownie</a>;
a sweet, rich syrupy beer with delicious chocolaty aroma. The name was pretty
much spot on describing how it smelt and tasted. It was not a session beer, but
it was nice to have a small glass of.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12842492655/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Mmmmm...

<p>After the beer festival finished up, Luke and Amanda headed off to
explore the south of England. I decided I wanted to stop moving for a while and
stayed put in Nottingham for a nice long time.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12843197605/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Matt reading important business news in the paper while having a nice ale by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7392/12843197605_f4b72d4e8b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Matt reading important business news in the paper while having a nice ale" class="img-responsive"><em>Matt reading important business news in the paper while having a nice ale</em></a></span></p>

<p>My days comprised of sleeping in, working on my Spanish and spinning poi. Then
when Matty got home from his crazy long days at work we&#8217;d go out and visit any
one of the many local pubs, trying as many different ales as humanly possible.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12843851254/in/set-72157641676939995" title="A barman pulling us a pint of Directors by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3726/12843851254_28ee0718ed_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="A barman pulling us a pint of Directors" class="img-responsive"><em>A barman pulling us a pint of Directors</em></a></span></p>

<p>It felt like a mutually beneficial situation. Matty got someone to help around
the house, some extra company, and a drinking buddy. I got the days to slow down
and relax without feeling like I was wasting my limited time in new city X, and
a great introduction to all that English ale has to offer.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12843460923/in/set-72157641676939995" title="And even more pump tags by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3786/12843460923_c49cc47b39_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="And even more pump tags" class="img-responsive"><em>And even more pump tags</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a few weeks of this it was time to head to London for Amanda and Luke&#8217;s
leaving Europe celebrations. Matty and I got the bus to Victoria Station, then
headed straight to Camden to have Lunch at a nice pub Matt knew. Their menu
contained the &#8220;Cheese and bacon dirty burger&#8221;. How can you go wrong with a name
like that?</p>

<p>After lunch we headed to a pub called The Old Haberdashery, where we were
meeting up with everyone. Amanda and Luke, Leigh and Nikki, and a few other
people we know who happen to be in London and had the afternoon free all made
it along.</p>

<p>After a lot of beers and reminiscing, we headed to the Boom Festival teaser
party, our main event for the evening, which turned out to be a terribly
organised disaster.</p>

<p>We spent two hours waiting in line to get into the venue, and this was with
everyone having pre-booked tickets, the event had sold out. There was a cloak
room line that didn&#8217;t move whatsoever in the 15 minutes I stood there before
decided I wouldn&#8217;t bother. I&#8217;d guess another 2 hours to cloak an item, and
another 3-4 to get it back at the end of the night.  A stupid token system at
the bar meant you had to queue up twice when you wanted a drink, or buy loads of
tokens and risk having a bunch left over at the end of the night. There was way
too many people packed into the tiny venue making the place so unbearably hot
that we went outside to the smoking area just to get out of the heat. This is in
London at the end of Autumn! I was so hot that I was comfortable outside in just
a T-shirt for ages before I stopped feeling overheated.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to say even in the face of all that I had a good time, but I didn&#8217;t.
Pretty much everything about the night sucked. I was getting so mad about
how poorly executed everything was that I got a yelling at from Nicolette about
how negative I was being. I completely understand not wanting to make a bad
situation seem worse than it is, but when the dust settled the next week I
don&#8217;t think anyone had a positive word to say about the event. I don&#8217;t know how
Boom Festival could let such a farce of a party tarnish their brand like that.</p>

<p>We left before the event finished, as soon as the trains to Cambridge were
running again. Like sleepless zombies we endured something like 3 changes back
and forth onto buses because of weekend track works. Thank you Amanda for
staying awake and making sure we got there in the end!</p>

<p>In Cambridge we were staying at Amanda&#8217;s good friend Andrew&#8217;s place. When we
arrived we walked in, he handed us bacon sandwiches (what a champion!) and then
we all lay down and got some much needed rest.</p>

<p>Andrew was heading off to visit his family, so we were sort of house sitting for
him for Amanda and Luke&#8217;s last few days in Europe. Cards against humanity (The
UK version) was played. £65 of fireworks were purchased and set off in a nearby
field (45 seconds of non-stop explosions). Cheese, wine and beer was consumed.
Good times were had. No photos were taken.</p>

<p>After our few days there, Matty drove Luke and Amanda to London.  By the time we
got there, it was peak hour, so we stopped at a suburb in the outskirts and had
a few drinks until the trains would have quietened down. We said our goodbyes
and wished Amanda and Luke well on their American travels, before making the
long drive back to Nottingham.</p>

<p>For my penultimate weekend in England, Matt kindly sorted us out some transport
so we could go and check out the one real thing on my list of stuff to see in
England: Stonehenge. I think the desire to see it stemmed from the movie
European Vacation, which is kind of lame, but seeing the real deal was pretty
cool.</p>

<p>On the drive there we were buffeted with ice cold winds, dark clouds and rain.
The wind ended up working in our favour, blowing us a clear patch in the sky
while we were waiting in line to get in. The blue skies lasted for nearly our
whole visit. The weather while we were there was stunning, some of the best I
saw during this visit to England.</p>

<p>I learnt some interesting stuff from the far too verbose audio guides. There&#8217;s
third of each pillar buried underground, meaning that the already quite large
stones are actually 50% bigger than they appear. They have little pegs and holes
to help keep the tops in place on the pillars. The heaviest one is estimated to
weight 45 tons. Another amazing construction project that nobody truly knows how
they accomplished it, although they have some theories that sound pretty
reasonable.</p>

<p>After Stonehenge we headed to Bristol to visit an old friend, Jen, and to check
out some of the Banksy pieces around the city. I got an iPhone app guide to his
work around the city, which sadly a large proportion of have been vandalised and
since painted over. It was awesome to see the ones that were still there though.</p>

<p>We caught up with Jen over a few drinks, then headed to a fancy little
microbrewery bar and had way to many more tasty beers, followed by an obligatory
going-to-bed kebab before sleeping in the van. I slept in the back (which I
found out was not exactly sealed from the outside air) and matt slept in the
cabin. I was glad to have a reasonable sleeping bag that night.</p>

<p>The next day Matt and I both felt rubbish, so we wandered around trying to find
somewhere that was open to get a decent breakfast. Eventually we found a place
called the Bristolian that had a great English breakfast, helping us both feel
much much better.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12845833954/in/set-72157641676939995" title="The Bristolian by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7459/12845833954_0ca9a2621c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The Bristolian" class="img-responsive"><em>The Bristolian</em></a></span></p>

<p>We spent the morning touring around Bristol some more, checking out the immense
amounts of great street art that decorates the city. I highly recommend checking
out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/sets/72157641676939995/">Flickr gallery for this
post</a> if you
like graffiti.</p>

<p>We decided to go and visit bath that day, a picturesque city full of beautiful
architecture. We walked around the city a bit, saw a stealthy bridge (shops
built on both sides of it hide the fact there&#8217;s a bridge there at all), before
making the long drive back to Nottingham.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12845536285/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Bath, the fancy neighbourhood by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3750/12845536285_afdcf35c21_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Bath, the fancy neighbourhood" class="img-responsive"><em>Bath, the fancy neighbourhood</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent a few of my last few days of this visit to England in London, revisiting
sites I&#8217;d been to a decade earlier when I lived an hour away in Ipswich. Lots of
nice nostalgia.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12845626835/in/set-72157641676939995" title="The guards at Buckingham Palace by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3686/12845626835_a94756ef08_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The guards at Buckingham Palace" class="img-responsive"><em>The guards at Buckingham Palace</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went to Buckingham Palace and the huge gardens nearby, walked over to Big Ben
and The Palace of Westminster, then walked along the Thames for a bit before it
started raining.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12845994175/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Palace of Westminster by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7304/12845994175_7a5c34b58f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Palace of Westminster" class="img-responsive"><em>Palace of Westminster</em></a></span></p>

<p>I headed over to Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square and bought some last
minute tickets to see &#8220;The Book of Mormon&#8221; for that evening, a musical by the
guys behind South Park.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12846419004/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Trafalgar Square by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2822/12846419004_90945b038e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Trafalgar Square in the rain" class="img-responsive"><em>Trafalgar Square in the rain</em></a></span></p>

<p>I tracked down a fancy London beard barber shop and got my beard shaped for way
too much money, but you only live once, right? I got some good tips about
shaping it myself (which I screwed up just a few months later) and some tips on
handlebar moustaches.</p>

<p>I visited the London Transport Museum which was quite an interesting collection
about all the eras and advancements in public transport in London. Funny to see
signs from the start of last century for the same stuff that people need to be
told today (don&#8217;t block the doors, move down the isle, let people off first). It
seems like common sense has never been common.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12846238255/in/set-72157641676939995" title="The problems of old are the same problems of today by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2853/12846238255_2e59be8e50_c.jpg" width="673" height="800" alt="The problems of old are the same problems of today" class="img-responsive"><em>The problems of old are the same problems of today</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;d hoped the museum would have a bit more of a focus on the underground than it
did. It was nearly completely missing information about the many abandoned
underground stations, or 3d models of how the whole network and it&#8217;s supporting
escalators/lifts fit together.</p>

<p>I went along to the Book of Mormon, which by that point was sold out completely,
but my seat was actually pretty decent on the ground floor with a good view of
the stage. One of the perks of going to the theatre alone! The musical was a
funny tale of two Mormons who get sent to Uganda to preach, one of who is a
compulsive liar, the other a &#8220;star&#8221; Mormon.  The star loses his faith, so the
liar steps up and makes up even crazier stuff than actual Mormonism to get the
Ugandans to stop doing bad things like killing one another, or raping babies
to cure their aids. I thought it poked a lot of fun of Mormons, while not
actually crossing any lines as far as South Park normally does.</p>

<p>The next morning I went and saw London bridge, which is pretty dull but had a
great view of the Tower Bridge, which I love to look at.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12846736544/in/set-72157641676939995" title="The Tower Bridge by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7355/12846736544_29eb123a9c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The Tower Bridge" class="img-responsive"><em>The Tower Bridge</em></a></span></p>

<p>I looped around and visited the Tower of London, did the tour led by a beefeater
which I enjoyed just as much as last time. They have great delivery of their
stories and jokes making it both informative and enjoyable.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12846375755/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Our beef-eater by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2822/12846375755_1554934914_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Our beef-eater" class="img-responsive"><em>Our beef-eater</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went through and saw the crown jewels, this time looking out in particular for
the big ones stolen from Africa and India that I&#8217;d learned about in my travels.
They don&#8217;t make very much note about that side of the story, or that they refuse
to return them.</p>

<p>An new interesting fact I learnt was that the tower was once used as a
menagerie, filled with all kinds of exotic animals. The animal husbandry back
then left a lot to be desired. For example they had ostriches but didn&#8217;t know
what they ate, so they tried feeding them iron nails, which of course killed
them. They also used to have a polar bear on a leash that could swim in the
Thames. Nuts!</p>

<p>I went past the monument for the great fire of London, an impressive pillar
mostly hidden by the large buildings around it, then got the tube to Camden
where I was staying for the night.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12846584095/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Fire of London monument by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3730/12846584095_65d308aebd_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Fire of London monument" class="img-responsive"><em>Fire of London monument</em></a></span></p>

<p>Camden has a counter-culture feel to it, and attracts some rather odd people.
One example was quite a talented girl who was busking near the train station on
an electric violin, while some douchebag sat metres in front of her listening to
his iPod. He moved along only when someone tapped him on the shoulder and
pointed out what an incredibly rude twat he was being.</p>

<p>I wandered around the markets, seeing loads of great street art, vintage and
Victorian (?) era clothes, and lots of other cool stuff to look at. I wish I had
unlimited cash and no bag weight restrictions so I could buy a whole new
wardrobe, try out a completely new style (or just <em>have</em> a style really).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12846680913/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Camden High Street by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7304/12846680913_f9e7fbede6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Camden High Street" class="img-responsive"><em>Camden High Street</em></a></span></p>

<p>I visited Cyberdog, which I&#8217;m told is practically mandatory when going to
Camden, a store that pretty much doubles as a night club. The lights are dimmed,
the UV lights are on, there&#8217;s a live hard trance DJ spinning records and
everything. The place was full of rave clothes and cool trinkets. There was a
cool Tetris night light that comes apart completely and the blocks light up as
you stack them in whatever order you please. Also, Pacman ghost ponchos! Quite
an unique and wonderful shop. Sadly they don&#8217;t allow you to use cameras inside
the store.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12847045074/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Cyberdog by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2893/12847045074_81f069cfc2_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Cyberdog" class="img-responsive"><em>Cyberdog</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent the evening checking out my hostels open mic night, where the acts
varied from extremely talented, to please-stop-now, this is painful.</p>

<p>The next morning mostly got wasted at the apple store. The camera in my phone
had been showing some weird graphics distortions, which meant they were happy to
replace it on the spot. Unfortunately this mean I then had a blank phone and
needed to restore from iCloud in order to have access to any of my important
stuff like Google Maps or my bus ticket back to Nottingham. It turns out the
wifi in an Apple Store gets hammered pretty heavily by all the people using it,
so it took forever and then some to restore.  Still, shiny brand new phone for
the third time!</p>

<p>The afternoon was entirely spent at the London Science Museum. A place full of
fascinating exhibitions of aviation, mechanical computers, the materials things
are made of, the human body and loads more. I spent 5 hours there before they
kicked everyone out and closed, but I wish I had more time as there was so many
more sections to visit.</p>

<p>I met up with my old friend Andrew, who lived in Australia for a year a while
back. We went to a nice pub called &#8220;The Cask&#8221; for some delicious ales and some
gourmet burgers, and a lot of catching up. We talked &#8220;shop&#8221; for a little while
and it was reassuring to still be able to feel like I&#8217;m not too far out of the
loop. I guess as quickly as tech changes, the things people enjoy ranting about
change much more slowly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12847002555/in/set-72157641676939995" title="Now that's how you name a beer! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3718/12847002555_508d328d95_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Now that's how you name a beer!" class="img-responsive"><em>Now that&#8217;s how you name a beer!</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got the bus home late that night, which didn&#8217;t make it into Nottingham until
around about 2am. I stumbled back from the bus station to Matty&#8217;s place and
promptly passed out.</p>

<p>The next morning Matty made us an epic breakfast for lunch, then we set out to
make one last visit to all the pubs in town before I left. In at Brewdog we had
a nip of <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/214">Tactical Nuclear Penguin</a>
each; one of their rarer, strong (32%), exotic and expensive drops.  Thankfully
at the Brewdog bars at least they&#8217;ll sell by the 30ml, instead of having to buy a
330ml bottle. It was superb, but it is an impossible beer to follow as the
flavour is just so intense.</p>

<p>On my final day in England, we drove out to a nice country pub. Sadly it had a
rather poor selection of ales, so we drove right back into town and found a
place doing an awesome Sunday roast for lunch. That pub was conveniently located
near the building which was used for Wayne manor in one of the Batman films, so
we checked that out too. It&#8217;s an impressive mansion with a huge green grounds
surrounding it.</p>

<p>The next day I was off to the airport bright and early to catch a flight to
Berlin, to find out just how large the gaps in my knowledge about the Cold War
really were.</p>

      <p>Leaving Turkey I took a ferry from Selçuk to Samos, the main gateway into the
Greek Islands from Turkey. I&#8217;d planned on heading straight from there to Ikaria
but the ferry to Ikaria didn&#8217;t run the same day so I stopped on Samos for a day
and had a look around. I found a cafe with wifi and looked up some cheap hotels,
then made the long walk to one of the nicer looking ones which turned out was
even cheaper than the prices I&#8217;d seen online because it was low season.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12374456543/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Samos from the water by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2829/12374456543_50b3d0ff27_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Samos from the water" class="img-responsive"><em>Samos from the water</em></a></span></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>My room with a beautiful view looking out over Samos beach and into the
Mediterranean. I was quite literally the only person in the whole hotel. They
asked me what time I wanted to have breakfast the next day, so I made myself get
up the next day at that time even though I didn&#8217;t feel like it, and found they&#8217;d
laid out a small buffet for me, it was very sweet of them. The staff there were
lovely and seemed really grateful to have me staying with them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12374911863/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Buffet breakfast for one by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3747/12374911863_569e014b39_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Buffet breakfast for one" class="img-responsive"><em>Buffet breakfast for one</em></a></span></p>

<p>The whole town of Samos felt eerily quiet. There was pretty much no one on
streets and pretty much all the shops but restaurants were empty. It made a nice
change after Turkey, feels like lazy Sunday every day, with nobody fighting to
get my attention. At this point in the trip I&#8217;m very happy that things are
quiet; I think that peak season in the islands would be horrible</p>

<p>While in Greece I ate a lot of Mediterranean salads, which consist of a huge
proportion of raw tomatoes, which in the past I have never really liked. Any
other form of tomato I&#8217;m fine with, but I&#8217;ve never been able to get past the
texture and flavour of raw ones.  I decided to try and push through that dislike
and eat a salad every day until I either liked them or hated myself for doing
it.  It actually didn&#8217;t take all that long to get to the point where I almost
enjoy them, I think the olive oil and lots of great feta and the freshness of
the tomatoes definitely helped. I&#8217;ve continued trying to eat any tomato that has
ended up on my plate even after leaving Greece (I was wondering if it was just
the Greek tomatoes I was liking) and it seems to have worked somewhat. I still
wouldn&#8217;t seek out raw tomatoes just yet, but I no longer feel like I need to eat
around them which is great. I don&#8217;t think there are any foods I don&#8217;t eat
because of the taste/texture anymore!</p>

<p>Out the window of my hotel I could see an abandoned old building over the other
side of the bay so I ventured over and explored it a bit. Most of the walls
(glass?) had been removed, and the place was mostly stripped out, but it didn&#8217;t
look like demolition was in any way in progress and it had a bit of an spooky
feeling to it. The rooftop would have made an awesome site for spinning some
fire at night!</p>

<p>The domestic ferries between the Greek Islands are gigantic! They&#8217;re how I&#8217;d
imagine a cruise ship would be like: multiple bars and snack cafes, seemingly
endless corridors, etc. I wandered around for a while and find the first class
area, which they let me into even though I only had a tight-arse ticket simply
because the boat is so empty. Win!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12374834555/in/set-72157640970103395" title="One of the Ferries.

Huuuuuuge!" class="img-responsive"><em>One of the Ferries. Huuuuuuge!</em></a></span></p>

<p>The ferry is so large and stable that I don&#8217;t need seasickness tablets for once,
and can get some blogging work done. This shit takes up way more time and effort
than I ever thought it would, but it&#8217;ll pay off when I&#8217;m done and have a
detailed record to look back at when I&#8217;m old and my memory is failing, and I
like to think at least my mum enjoys reading them.</p>

<p>My next island was Ikaria, an island I&#8217;d heard about from another traveller who
told me how they had some of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103744881">the longest lifespans in the
world</a> because
everyone was super laid back (I was told that shops would &#8220;close&#8221; but leave the
doors open and unattended, so you could leave the money for your purchase on the
counter if you needed something).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12509720573/in/set-72157640970103395" title="First sight of Ikaria by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7391/12509720573_24c709c159_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="First sight of Ikaria" class="img-responsive"><em>First sight of Ikaria</em></a></span></p>

<p>They&#8217;re also famed for having naturally radioactive radon hot springs around the
island. I went for a walk to Therma, a little town over the hill from where I
was staying to have a look where they have some springs diverted into buildings
for a more western style hot spring experience, but I decide it&#8217;s not for me.
The walk up over the hill is very scenic, passing a lot of beautiful cliffy
terrain.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12509645095/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Ikaria hillside by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7372/12509645095_c500edb35d_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Ikaria hillside" class="img-responsive"><em>Ikaria hillside</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ate dinner most nights at a nice little restaurant that was on the flat level
between two of the many staircases that weave up the hills of the town.
Everything I ate was amazingly delicious, very tender meats and great salads.
There were also lots of very curious stray cats and kittens investigating
around, one little kitten even tried to jump up on my table but slipped right
back off again.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12509731443/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Nice little restaturant I frequented, half way down a multi-segment flight of stairs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3709/12509731443_f90f102f08_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Nice little restaturant I frequented, half way down a multi-segment flight of stairs" class="img-responsive"><em>Nice little restaturant I frequented, half way down a multi-segment flight of stairs</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ended up going to one of the more traditional radioactive hot springs where
the water comes out of the ground right near the ocean at about 50-60ºC (ie. way
too hot to be comfortable) but it quickly mixes with the sea water giving you a
lovely gradient of temperatures to bath in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12510219904/in/set-72157640970103395" title="This whole area sheltered in the rocks had warm water of varying temperatures by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5498/12510219904_56d50745f3_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="This whole area sheltered in the rocks had warm water of varying temperatures" class="img-responsive"><em>This whole area sheltered in the rocks had warm water of varying temperatures</em></a></span></p>

<p>The rocks are all stained a rusty brown colour form the radon near the hottest
parts, and then out further as the water cools enough for things to grow the
rocks are covered in green moss or algae. I lazed about in them for about half
an hour, figuring with the life expectancy statistics for the island the
radiation can&#8217;t be <em>that</em> bad for you</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12509891903/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Further out where the water was a little cooler it encouraged green moss (algae?) to grow by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7377/12509891903_cc0a5828ee_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Further out where the water was a little cooler it encouraged green moss (algae?) to grow" class="img-responsive"><em>Further out where the water was a little cooler it encouraged green moss (algae?) to grow</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next island I headed to was Syros, the island that the ferries to
practically everywhere seem to pass through. My evening ferry was quite a bit
slower than I expected and didn&#8217;t arrive until 3am, and of course I had no
accommodation sorted out in advance :O</p>

<p>It all worked out perfectly though, there were some guys at the ferry terminal
asking if I needed a room, I asked them what their prices were and went with the
cheapest one and ended up in a nice little place where I had the rooftop
apartment with a kitchen and its own little private courtyard and beautiful
views looking out ~270º around the island; up the hill to the cathedrals and
out to the bay and the Mediterranean. There was even a little shady park across
the road to hang out in and read or spin poi!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12510302884/in/set-72157640970103395" title="My little private courtyard outside my room by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3729/12510302884_3c30531ba4_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My little private courtyard outside my room" class="img-responsive"><em>My little private courtyard outside my room</em></a></span></p>

<p>I really liked Syros, it felt a lot more like an island that people live on year
round. There still weren&#8217;t many tourists but the place didn&#8217;t feel completely
deserted. Food prices were a little more expensive, but the food itself was of
very good quality.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t actually do any touristy stuff to write about on Syros, I mostly just
spent my time relaxing, reading and spinning poi and it was a great place for
it.</p>

<p>Next I got a fast ferry from Syros to Mykonos, an island that I had high hopes for from
others high recommendations. That fast ferry lived up to its name, pulling into
the port and turning around it came in with such speed it looked like it was
going to do a big fishtale into the dock or something.</p>

<p>I wandered around the ferry a bit, this one being the most crowded one I&#8217;d been
on yet, exploring outside a bit and then found door leading into what turned out
to be some sort of evacuation stairs. There were some staff in their on a break
but they didn&#8217;t seem to care that I was there. I found a fire door from that
stairway to inside and then found myself in the much more spacious Business
class section that you needed to present your ticket to get into if you came via
the normal entrance. I kept a low profile and relaxed in spacious glory, not
like those schmucks in economy :P Intentionally getting lost for the win!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12510133835/in/set-72157640970103395" title="People about to charge off the ferry onto Mykonos by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7390/12510133835_15ebca351b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="People about to charge off the ferry onto Mykonos" class="img-responsive"><em>People about to charge off the ferry onto Mykonos</em></a></span></p>

<p>Mykonos was actually a bit of a disappointment. The restaurants are all really
overpriced, the end of shoulder season meant that there weren&#8217;t many tourists
around (which after a few weeks of not really meeting <em>anyone</em> it gets pretty
lonely and I&#8217;d decided maybe having <em>some</em> tourists would be a good thing), and
there didn&#8217;t seem to be anywhere you could go and just hang out. There seemed to
be no public spaces, parks or even benches, all the beaches are lined by
restaurant that want to sell you overpriced drinks or are covered in sun lounges
that you have to pay for the privilege of sitting on. It seems like somewhere
you come to in the high season with a bunch of rich friends to get drunk and
party every night, and then sloth around on overpriced sun lounges to nurse your
hangover.</p>

<p>I actually ended up living off food from little gyros shops while I was here
because I could get a gyros, a Greek salad and a drink there for less than just
the salad at a real restaurant.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my time there even the weather turned ugly, most days not
reaching 16ºC and being extremely windy; I liked to think of it as helpfully
getting me prepared for England :P</p>

<p>I made a trip to Paradise Beach, a huge resort area which was almost completely
devoid of human life and didn&#8217;t really live up to its name at all. Back home it
would just be called &#8220;generic dull beach without any surf and lots of ugly
sun lounges&#8221;</p>

<p>Final stop in Greece was in the capital, Athens. I had low expectations for
Athens because I&#8217;d had a few friends talk the place right down, but I actually
really enjoyed it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12521796675/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Athens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2853/12521796675_0ba9b8179b_c.jpg" width="800" height="221" alt="Athens" class="img-responsive"><em>Athens</em></a></span></p>

<p>I stayed in a nice sociable hotel and went on a free walking tour on my first
day and met a number of really nice people and saw many of the sights around
Athens. We had a very charismatic guide, George, who claimed to be an
archaeologist and taught us how to identify different column types and where
fires had occurred. It was all good stuff and we covered a good number of the
ruins around the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12510842254/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Our guide, he claims he's an archeologist, I have my doubts but he was a good guide none the less by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3714/12510842254_c72ac0e297_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Our guide, he claims he's an archeologist, I have my doubts but he was a good guide none the less" class="img-responsive"><em>Our guide, he claims he&#8217;s an archeologist, I have my doubts but he was a good guide none the less</em></a></span></p>

<p>I met up again later with a pretty girl from the tour for some drinks and
trivia, which we were appalling at. In trivia I generally rely on the other
people in the team because I just don&#8217;t seem to retain the sort of information
that they ask questions about, but she was very much in the same boat so we
ended up just making stuff up for a bunch of the questions. Good fun!</p>

<p>I went and explored the Acropolis and the Parthenon up on the hill, overlooking
everything. The Parthenon was a bit of a zoo, with throngs of people, long slow
queues to actually get in, and large tour groups everywhere; but the rest of the
Acropolis was actually relatively uncrowded and very pleasant to just stop and
appreciate it all.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12521887083/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Parthenon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7415/12521887083_a68958c26a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Parthenon" class="img-responsive"><em>Parthenon</em></a></span></p>

<p>I visited the Agora which has a very well preserved temple that is almost
entirely still standing,</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12510502765/in/set-72157640970103395" title="Athens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7398/12510502765_794aef0d23_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Temple of Hephaestus in the sea of Athens" class="img-responsive"><em>Temple of Hephaestus in the sea of Athens</em></a></span></p>

<p>And a reconstruction of one of the long market buildings (using a lot of new
materials) which was <em>huge</em>. 50 Columns, 4M tall give a very imposing effect.
Very impressive to think these structures were there so far back in the past.</p>

<p>All up I quite enjoyed my time in Greece, especially Athens, but I cant help but
wonder what the islands would have been like maybe just a few weeks earlier, and
travelling with some friends. The islands don&#8217;t really seem solo backpacker
friendly, there&#8217;s a distinct lack of hostels on them.</p>

      <p>After Istanbul our next stop was in Göreme, where Amanda, Luke, and I, stayed in
a fairy chimney hotel. These were rock formation that had been eroded away into
conical shapes, that had rooms carved into them, with some brickwork to divide
up the space.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11922915693/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Me in front of my cave hotel in G&#xF6;reme by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3751/11922915693_7c1de35fca_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Me in front of my cave hotel in G&#xF6;reme" class="img-responsive"><em>Me in front of my cave hotel in G&#xF6;reme</em></a></span></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We went on several tours that took us around to many of the highlights of the area.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11923143174/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Passageway in the underground city by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7305/11923143174_5ba05eb4ec_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Passageway in the underground city" class="img-responsive"><em>Passageway in the underground city</em></a></span></p>

<p>We visited Derinkuyo, the underground city that&#8217;s 16 levels deep, 8 of which we
visited. It was quite similar to the Chu Chi tunnels in Vietnam, but generally
much taller, although we did go down a few very very short &amp; dark ones where you
pretty much had to crawl. We were told that the estimated capacity of the city
was about 5000 people.</p>

<p>We took a walk though the Ihlara valley, a very scenic valley lined with caves,
pigeon holes, a cave church and a creek running down the bottom. Actually seeing
real life pigeon holes gave me a real &#8220;wow, I&#8217;d never even though about that&#8221;
moment abut the pigeon holes that teachers have in their staff rooms; they
really do look quite similar.</p>

<p>We were taken on a tour of a carpet making factory which had silk dyed in all
the colours of the rainbow. We saw a woman making a carpet with 100 knots per
square cm, which is quite a lot.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11923393174/" title="Silk carpet colours by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7322/11923393174_f93c4a25cd_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Silk carpet colours" class="img-responsive"><em>Silk carpet colours</em></a></span></p>

<p>We were taken to a show room and shown a bunch of carpets, each unrolled with a
lot of showmanship, and told how to tell a real fancy silk carpet over a cotton
one, but in all honestly I thought the cotton ones felt a lot nicer and softer
and were hugely cheaper.</p>

<p>One night we went and saw a traditional dancing show, show casing many kinds of
traditional Turkish dance. First up was some whirling dervishes dressed in
white, spinning under UV lights with all the other lights dimmed down. Although
seeing them was actually the original draw card for me, I didn&#8217;t actually find
them all that interesting so I was glad their part of the show was short.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925904714/in/set-72157639724831244" title="UV whirling dervishes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3682/11925904714_4e3a280f9b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="UV whirling dervishes" class="img-responsive"><em>UV whirling dervishes</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were many other styles of dancing with the men and women in some very
fancy costumes, and of course some belly dancing.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925508115/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Boobs! and belly dancing by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3779/11925508115_f0ae1be732_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Boobs! and belly dancing" class="img-responsive"><em>Boobs! and belly dancing</em></a></span></p>

<p>In one part of the show they had some crowd participation where they got
everyone up on their feet in a circle around the middle part of the room. Amanda
kindly volunteered me for one part where I had to go out in the &#8220;stage&#8221; and copy
the &#8220;seductive&#8221; dance moves of one of the guys to try and win a kiss from
another female volunteer from the audience, which I of course fail at doing
(they later pick her partner out form the audience, who surprise surprise is the
one she kisses).</p>

<p>I got up early my last morning in Göreme to see the hot air balloons flying
over. We didn&#8217;t actually go up in one because we&#8217;d only just done a balloon ride
in Africa a few weeks earlier but it was beautiful to see so many balloons
floating over the town.</p>

<p>From Göreme we got the night bus to Antalya down on the Mediterranean coast, and
learnt our lesson in &#8220;a night on a bus does not really get you an extra day
anywhere&#8221; because you sleep so poorly that you just want to nap all day once you
arrive. It was a pretty decent coach, with in seat entertainment for every seat
just like a plane, but it stopped every few hours and was generally hard to get
any sleep on.</p>

<p>I made myself go out exploring in the heat that first day there and found the
very modern main street surrounding the old city (where we were staying), with a
water feature running down the length of it between the road and the tram line.</p>

<p>There was a cool pedestrian street with 100s of open umbrellas
making a sort of shade over it which made some great photos.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925813553/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Umbrella street! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7395/11925813553_20ce39c8e0_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Umbrella street!" class="img-responsive"><em>Umbrella street!</em></a></span></p>

<p>Pretty much every inch of pavement in Antalya (and just about everywhere in
Turkey) was made of marble, polished by the millions of people walking on the,
which makes them very slippery and nearly put me on my arse more than a few
times. I hate to think what it would be like in the wet.</p>

<p>Luke and I had a &#8220;small&#8221; night out where we went over the road to the bar across
from where we were staying for a few quiet beers, which lead to a lot of very
noisy beers, which somehow led to us cranking
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/neelix">Neelix</a> over the bar sound system, the bar
tender rocking out to it, me breaking out the poi and attracting some locals to
come and watch the spectacle.</p>

<p>Luke and I woke up the next day with no recollection of having paid, and
returned sheepishly later that afternoon only to be told that it&#8217;s all good and
we apparently had. Quiet drinks fail.</p>

<p>We had nasty hangovers that could only be cured by going and getting a decent
breakfast at the beautiful Castle Cafe, with stunning views over the
Mediterranean,</p>

<p>Followed by an afternoon down at a private beach were we could
laze in the sun under umbrellas and read, swim and snorkel a bit.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925622605/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Private beach by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7380/11925622605_5801810ebe_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Private beach" class="img-responsive"><em>Private beach</em></a></span></p>

<p>While in Antalya I made a visit to a 600 year old Turkish bath, an experience that had come highly
recommended from just about everyone I&#8217;d spoken to about them, and it lived up
to the expectations.</p>

<p>Nobody in the place spoke English so the whole process was carried out with
pointing and gesturing. I was sent into a little room with a towel to get
changed into, which then turned out to double as a giant locker to lock my stuff
up in.</p>

<p>I was then sent downstairs into the actual bath area into a small marble room
containing a hairy man sluicing water about. He sends me into the next room with
a bit of a grunt and a point of his finger.</p>

<p>The next room is built in the shape of a large cross with very high vaulted
ceilings, and several smaller rooms opening off it. Inside it was quite humid
but not hot. There nobody else in the room with me and every move I make seems
to echo quite loudly.  I sit for a while wondering if I should be doing
something, then try sluicing myself with some water and wait some more until
eventually the hairy man returns and gestures that I follow him.</p>

<p>He gets me to lie face down on a marble slab, with a semi-circle pillow under my
face and a bit of pool noodle under my shins. He then pours warm water all over
me, then scrubs me down with a loofah glove. Next he gets a pillowcase-like sack
that&#8217;s full of soapy suds, fills it with air and then squeezes it out through
the sack to make foam for the soap massage, which seems like pretty much a
normal massage but with soap.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m turned over and the process is repeated on my front, with the addition of
some quite rough amateur chiropractic work involving crossing my arms over to
the elbow and shoving until there&#8217;s crack.</p>

<p>Finally I&#8217;m rinsed off with water, then led out to cool off and drink some apple
tea and eat some fresh fruit before heading back into my change room to get
dressed. I certainly walked away feeling cleaner than I had since going to
Africa. It would be the perfect thing to tack onto the end of Rainbow Serpent
Festival each year! :D</p>

<p>Our next stop was Pamukkale, which is famous for its massive salt formation hill
thingy which we first saw from right where the bus dropped us off. In looks a
lot like a ski slope except the weather is painfully hot and it&#8217;s covered in
women in bikini&#8217;s posing for their boyfriends for their next Facebook avatars.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925926943/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Rainbow beanbags looking onto Pamukkale.

It looks like a sky slope!" class="img-responsive"><em>Rainbow beanbags looking onto Pamukkale. It looks like a sky slope!</em></a></span></p>

<p>Most of the slope has water running down it most of the time (I&#8217;ll come back to
this later) and there are signs everywhere warning that it is wet and could be
slippery, but we quickly found out from out first step that it&#8217;s actually quite a roughly
textured surface and not at all slippery. There are pools all the way up the
slope which look man made, each pool being slightly warmer than the last as you
make you way up to the source.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926542516/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Me in front of what looks like giant cauliflower by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3756/11926542516_b400cb2c35_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Me in front of what looks like giant cauliflower" class="img-responsive"><em>Me in front of what looks like giant cauliflower</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the top you see there&#8217;s a lot of plumbing and artificial terraces, making it
feel a bit like a natural treasure that&#8217;s been destroyed. I did some research
and found out that the state it is in today is actually way better than when it
got UNESCO conservation status in 1986, before which it had been royally screwed
up. There used to be a bitumen road right up the slope (where you&#8217;re allowed to
walk today, and where the man man pools are) and hotels built at the top on top
of the ruins of Hierapolis; incredible to think they could let that happen. The
waste from the hotels had just been pumped out onto the salt slopes, staining
the whole thing dirty brown colours instead of pure white.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926162064/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Like a winter wonderland, but with more people swimming by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5476/11926162064_97d9839037_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Like a winter wonderland, but with more people swimming" class="img-responsive"><em>Like a winter wonderland, but with more people swimming</em></a></span></p>

<p>Them turning off the water to various parts actually gives the sun a chance to bleach
parts of the salt slope to try and undo some of the damage, so even though it
feels a bit artificial I think it&#8217;s a good thing what they&#8217;re doing.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926145184/in/set-72157639724831244" title="The place is surreal looking by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3739/11926145184_5f2aa8b3be_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The place is surreal looking" class="img-responsive"><em>The place is surreal looking</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went back a second time and found that the water was routed a completely
different way, creating new waterfalls in places and stopping others. I went up
the top and explored the ruins of Hierapolis, probably the only place in the
world where you&#8217;ll find bikini clad girls posing in an ancient amphitheatre, and
on other ancient ruins.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926007323/in/set-72157639724831244" title="It's not every day you see girls in bikini's posing in roman ruins for their friend with an iPad by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5550/11926007323_0369614729_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="It's not every day you see girls in bikini's posing in roman ruins for their friend with an iPad" class="img-responsive"><em>It&#8217;s not every day you see girls in bikini&#8217;s posing in roman ruins for their friend with an iPad</em></a></span></p>

<p>Our next stop was in Selçuk where our accommodation, Wallabies Hotel has a
lovely view of the aqueducts that run through the city, although the bathroom
door is missing the handle and we need pliers to open it, there&#8217;s no hot water
and there&#8217;s some festival going on outside until late into the night making tons
of noise and the windows block nothing. In short it&#8217;s a bit of a shithole,
especially considering the travel agent who organised it claimed how he had lots
of very fussy Korean customers and none ever complained. I&#8217;ve stayed in plenty
of worse hostels, but they weren&#8217;t claiming to be hotels.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926182813/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Aquaduct out our window by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7385/11926182813_b5d03679ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Aquaduct out our window" class="img-responsive"><em>Aquaduct out our window</em></a></span></p>

<p>The draw card around Selçuk is the ancient ruins of Ephesus (or Efes), a 1000
year old Greek city. Tour buses seem to arrive there at regular intervals so you
need to time your movements so you&#8217;re in between the hoards of 30-40 people in
each group to get a look at the place without it feeling like your at some sort
of circus, but when you time it right it can feel like you&#8217;ve got the place
almost to yourself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926059043/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Ephesus amphitheatre by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5503/11926059043_0659c79edc_c.jpg" width="800" height="248" alt="Ephesus amphitheatre" class="img-responsive"><em>Ephesus amphitheatre</em></a></span></p>

<p>There are some very impressive terrace houses there, once owned by individual
families. The archways in them and the mosaic floors would be considered quite
impressive features in a modern house so it&#8217;s sort of mind blowing to think that
individual families dwelled in such luxury thousands of years back. Naturally
the families were high up in various religious groups <em>rolls eyes</em> so very
philanthropic they tend to be.</p>

<p>Another thing of note the façade of the ancient Library of Celsius which is
really cool. The architects used thinner columns on the outside and thicker ones
towards the middle to add even more grandeur to the already impressive size of
it using optical illusion. Pretty amazing technology for 1000 years back.</p>

<p>There was a long marble avenue that lead down to where the harbour used to be,
but it was roped off not far down from the amphitheatre. I wanted to see what
was down there, so I found an unmarked path through the scrub that led in the
right general direction which eventually came out at the very far other end of
the avenue. I could see no signs of the port, but looking down the avenue back
towards the city it was easy to imagine how vastly wealthy the city must have
been back in it&#8217;s day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925884335/in/set-72157639724831244" title="I'm not supposed to be here, the other end of the harbour road, zoomed out to to 28mm by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7436/11925884335_1a7ecfca8d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="I'm not supposed to be here, the other end of the harbour road, zoomed out to to 28mm" class="img-responsive"><em>I&#8217;m not supposed to be here, the other end of the harbour road, zoomed out to to 28mm</em></a></span></p>

<p>I took a slightly different way back that led past harbour gymnasium, parts of
which looked like they could fall down at any minute and actually stated to feel
pretty unsafe, wondering if there could be large not-yet-excavated caverns below
me, so I quickly made my way back to the normal path. Just as I got back where I
was supposed to be I passed a security guy going the other direction talking on
his radio. I like to imagine that I got spotted from afar and he&#8217;d been sent off
to tell me to get out of there, but he was probably just sneaking off for a lazy
break or something.</p>

<p>While in the area I made a day trip to the beach. On arriving, the forest
leading up to it felt pretty much like it could have been somewhere on the north
coast of NSW, lots and lots of spaced out gum trees. Seems to strange to find
them in large numbers in other countries of the world.</p>

<p>As I approach the beach it looks brown and pretty unappealing, but as I reach
the water I find the water moving over the sand actually makes the sand sparkle
like gold glitter. It&#8217;s extremely pretty, but not an effect that translated very
well to still photos, or even video, but trust me I tried!</p>

<p>After Selçuk I parted ways with Luke and Amanda as they were flying on to Rome
and I had decided that I wanted to spend more time along the Mediterranean
coastline. I hate saying goodbye in general, I never seem to be able to pick a
moment that feels natural, but longer goodbyes are the worst. It was at least
nice to know it was only for a month or two before we&#8217;d cross paths again, and
in a way it felt nice to have the freedom to do whatever I felt like doing
again, without having to consider what anyone else wanted. Maybe a little
selfish to be thinking that way, but so what?</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926407314/in/set-72157639724831244" title="The shiny lights of Bodrum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3758/11926407314_9bd6a9105c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The shiny lights of Bodrum" class="img-responsive"><em>The shiny lights of Bodrum</em></a></span></p>

<p>My first solo stop was in Bodrum, where I visited their underwater archaeology
museum, which is in the Bodrum castle. Bodrum itself was a pretty horrible
resort town; think beached completely covered in sun-lounges with loads of bright
red tourists sunning themselves laid out on them&#8230; really not my sort of place.
My lack of interest in the city combined with the inspiration to go diving from
seeing all the information about how they lift the shipwreck relics from the sea
bed had me leaving pretty quickly and heading for Kaş.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925961955/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Sea floor recreation of an ancient shipwreck by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7365/11925961955_d4bf0a60cc_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Sea floor recreation of an ancient shipwreck" class="img-responsive"><em>Sea floor recreation of an ancient shipwreck</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was fantastic to get back in the water and dive again once I got to Kaş. I
went out with a shop called Bougainville Divers with a fairly advanced
divemaster/guide, Peter, who dives with a side mount setup (no tank on his back,
they&#8217;re clipped loosely at his sides instead), a setup I&#8217;d heard about but never
actually seen anyone using before. It sure is an interesting way to rig your
gear and actually lends itself to travelling with your own gear quite well. From
the feedback I got from him, it seems that all my shallow water pier diving back
in Melbourne has paid off in spades and my trim in the water looks like that of
someone with two or three times as many dives as I have done. A nice little ego
boost!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11935191264/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Having a look inside by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3778/11935191264_007cb56ff0_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Having a look inside" class="img-responsive"><em>Having a look inside</em></a></span></p>

<p>Marine life in the Mediterranean is actually pretty sparse compared to
everywhere else I&#8217;ve ever dived, the area has been heavily overfished and even
with Kaş being in the middle of a conservation area there&#8217;s not a lot of fish
around. I did see a lot of tiny stuff like nudibranches, but pretty much no schools
of fish, and even very few individual fish.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11934780975/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Group photo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2824/11934780975_5e57d070ee_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Group photo" class="img-responsive"><em>Group photo</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got to do a dive at the Dakota, a Turkish Red Cross plane (a DC3) which was
bought, stripped and sunk as an artificial reef. Because it&#8217;s not a plane that&#8217;s
crashed, the whole thing is intact and it&#8217;s really quite surreal to see what is
a somewhat large plane, 30 odd meters underwater with fish swimming through
it. It&#8217;s pretty cool to get to have a look through the cockpit window and swim
around and have a look at the propellers and the tail fin, and even penetrate
into the hull of the plane.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11935009263/in/set-72157639724831244" title="Me @ The Dakota DC3 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3753/11935009263_54404c9d38_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Me @ The Dakota DC3" class="img-responsive"><em>Me @ The Dakota DC3</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also dived a few shipwrecks in the area, some steel ones that were quite
obviously ships, and some wooden ones of which very little was left. Some of the
wooden ones were at least somewhat modern, as the things that remained were PVC
piping and a ceramic toilet! Others were much much older, with broken amphora
(ancient ceramic jars) and ancient stone boat anchors being all that was still
evidence that it was a ship.</p>

<p>While in Kaş I got in touch with some people through couchsurfing and met up
with them; Ümit, a Turkish dude who spun fire poi and Maie-Anna, a girl from
Germany who lives in Kaş now and was bursting at the seams with energy. I ended
up going out dancing with them at the very basic local nightclub that played
very trashy music but it was lots of fun.</p>

<p>After Kaş I headed to Olympos, a sleepy little village right near the ruins of
the ancient city of Olympos. I stayed in a great hostel that had a huge outdoor
area consisting of tree-house lounges and hammocks, which I made extensive use of
in the week I stayed there.</p>

<p>Every morning there was a huge buffet breakfast that filled me up enough so I
didn&#8217;t really need to eat lunch, and then also a huge delicious buffet dinner,
all included in the accommodation. All for ~$20 a day!</p>

<p>It was a great chance to unwind after travelling too fast, for too long, and
finally de-stress a bit. I had lots of much needed alone time, sometimes
wandering off and finding a spot to myself where hours would pass without even
hearing another person.</p>

<p>My week consisted of walks down to the beach, practicing my poi, and lying in
hammocks reading. It was a lovely way to unwind.</p>

<p>One day I climbed up to the ruins of an old castle up on the hill. The path
leading up to it passed by lots of overgrown brickwork up to the castle, where
the remnants of a two storey building with a few arch doorways were still
standing. I could see where the floor of the second floor would have been, with
the regularly spaced holes in the wall where the floorboard supports would have
been. Another day I swam out to a not-so-secret cave and found that some of the
ground I was standing on taking photos that earlier day was actually on top of
an huge arch, probably 40 meters above the water and rocks. Eeek!</p>

<p>The last place of note I visited in Turkey was up to Mount Chimaera, where
fire spews out from holes in the ground which was really neat to witness.
Apparently the locations of the fires change daily as some fires go out and
others new ones spark up. Stories tell that the fires used to be bright enough
for the ships to see, so it was sort of like a ancient lighthouse for the area.
It&#8217;s also where the original Olympic flame came from, and has reportedly burned
continuously for 2500 years</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>After flying into Istanbul Attaturk airport we spent the morning hiding out at
the airport in the air conditioning and waiting for the time we&#8217;d agree to meet
at our apartment with our AirBNB host. We got a taxi from the airport and my
first impressions of Istanbul proper were that everything appeared so clean,
modern and organised. The highways were multi-lane, there was nobody wandering
out trying to sell things to passing traffic, traffic flowed very quickly and
efficiently, people drove on the correct side of the road and actually stayed in
their lanes for the most part. It&#8217;s amazing how much your direct prior
experiences can colour your perceptions of a place, the Turkey we were seeing
was at odds to the reputation that the place generally has for it&#8217;s drivers.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11436642894/in/set-72157638802576105" title="The beautiful view of the Bosphorus from our apartment by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5502/11436642894_59fd09327c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The beautiful view of the Bosphorus from our apartment" class="img-responsive"><em>The beautiful view of the Bosphorus from our apartment</em></a></span></p>

<p>The apartment we stayed in was located very close to Taksim Square, consisting
of the whole top floor of the building and a rooftop courtyard and a fantastic
view of the Bosporus. Having modern conveniences like a fridge, a washing
machine and air conditioning felt very luxurious after having just spent 5 weeks
camping in tents.</p>

<p>As soon as we&#8217;d put our bags down we headed out in search of food and quickly
located our first kebabs of the trip. Very delicious and super cheap too. We
continued up to Taksim square and found that the top corner of the square
consisted of about 6-7 kebab shops all side by side, which we soon dubbed the
kebab district. We made pretty regular trips to the kebab district on a quest to
find out which one had the best kebabs but it was sort of inconclusive, they
were all delicious!</p>

<p>Sadly that first night I got the news of my grandmother&#8217;s death. She was my last
remaining grandparent and it was going to be sad news to get whenever it came,
but being surrounded by friend was probably the best I could have hoped for
while being so far from home.</p>

<p>All of us headed over to the Egyptian bazaar the next morning to do some
exploring. The Egyptian bazaar is right next to the grand bazaar, but a bit
smaller and (apparently) a bit less tourist focused although looking back I&#8217;m
not remembering a lot of stuff there I could imagine the locals coming to buy.
Maybe the bulk tobacco and spices, but not the 100s of hookahs or the Kilos of
Turkish delight.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11436843495/in/set-72157638802576105" title="More spices by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2820/11436843495_0b229d3f5d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Piles of spices" class="img-responsive"><em>Piles of spices</em></a></span></p>

<p>We all agreed the place felt fairly busy and bustling, but people seemed a lot
less forceful about getting your attention or dragging you into their shops than
we were used to so it felt quite a bit more relaxed than Africa. It&#8217;s
interesting to read reviews of the bazaar on trip advisor where a lot of people
complain about how invasive the touts are and how they couldn&#8217;t cope with it
all, and it really goes to show just how subjective all the reviews on there are
and how much each individuals past experiences factor in.</p>

<p>We went an wandered around the Grand Bazaar, which as the name implies is a
really huge market. The place had a strange air of familiarity to it and
eventually it clicked that Constantinople that Assassin&#8217;s Creed Revelations is
set in, is the same city that eventually became Istanbul. I realised I&#8217;d already
visited the Topkapi palace virtually, and even assassinated a Czar there. I find
it thoroughly impressive that I can start to feel like I know my way around the
city, based on the map design of a video game set in the city hundred of years
earlier.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11437094434/in/set-72157638802576105" title="Colourful lamps by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7419/11437094434_39241c19c2_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Colourful lamps" class="img-responsive"><em>Colourful lamps</em></a></span></p>

<p>We found the carpet sellers had interesting and quite well thought out tactics
for trying to get you into their shops. Instead of just outright saying &#8220;come to
my shop&#8221;, they&#8217;d often just be wandering around near tourist areas and off some
help or show you around, tell you some historical information about the place;
just generally being friendly and helpful, and then after they&#8217;d developed a
feeling of being in-debt to them, then they&#8217;d very friendlily offer to take you
to their friend/brother/cousins shop and show you around.</p>

<p>This obviously still didn&#8217;t work well on me (not having a home is nice like
that), but I have to admit I actually felt a bit bad for them compared to the
average touts, and could imagine the tactics would be quite successful on a lot
of people, in at least getting them into the shop.</p>

<p>One of the less commonly visited places we visited in Istanbul was the
Australian consulate. Not because somebody lost their passport, but to vote in
the Federal election. The consulate was on quite a high floor in the Ritz
Carlton hotel so the views were fantastic.</p>

<p>Amanda, Luke and myself visited the cistern, A huge underground chamber with row
after row of columns supporting the ground above it. It&#8217;s claim to fame is
having been in a Bond movie (it starts to feel like every city has at least one
place from a Bond film after a while), and has some mysterious Medusa heads on
their sides as the base of two of the columns. Extra weird when you remember
this was a water storage chamber, so nobody would have actually been able to
ever see them in it&#8217;s day cause it would be full of water.</p>

<p>We went into The Blue Mosque, which was a very beautiful building, but the
inside of it felt spoilt by the very low hanging racks of lights, suspended from
the ceiling by a thousand wires. It really stopped the space from feeling as
vast and open as it could have felt.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11438096975/in/set-72157638802576105" title="Inside the Blue Mosque, soooooo many wires by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3788/11438096975_28ff49fcea_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Inside the Blue Mosque, soooooo many wires" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside the Blue Mosque, soooooo many wires</em></a></span></p>

<p>We were all super impressed to see that they even let women pray inside, but
only from inside a little caged off part at the back where they cant be seen. So
very progressive, nice one Islam! You&#8217;ve managed to make Tony Abbott seem a little
less misogynistic in comparison.</p>

<p>We met up that afternoon with Leigh and Nicolette for our last drinks together
as it was their last night before they were leaving us and heading back home to
Scotland :(</p>

<p>Luke, Amanda and myself went out on an evening boat cruise on the Bosporus,
which was a beautiful chance to see the city at night from the water.</p>

<p>We&#8217;d seen that a dentist convention was being held in town, and we actually
passed it, lit up Colgate sign being the give-away.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11438451604/in/set-72157638802576105" title="Ain't no party like a Colgate party by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7405/11438451604_490dc39db6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ain't no party like a Colgate party" class="img-responsive"><em>Ain&#8217;t no party like a Colgate party</em></a></span></p>

<p>We passed under the first bridge with it&#8217;s lit up cables and got a really good
view of it&#8217;s light show.</p>

<p>Having lost Leigh and Nic, we moved from our AirBNB apartment to a hostel over
in the old part of the city. The place had very friendly staff, the room was
pretty nice, and up on the top floor of the hostel there was a rooftop bar with
a pretty amazing view of the Hagia Sofia.</p>

<p>I did some solo exploration of some of the museums and palaces as Amanda was
unwell and Luke wanted to work on some HCTP videos. I got a Museum card and
headed to the Archaeology museum which had an interesting exhibit on excavated
shipwrecks, well preserved because they&#8217;d been buried in silt, but they&#8217;d been
wet so long that they could not let them dry out naturally without the wood
warping, so they&#8217;d had to spend many weeks making them dry extremely slowly.</p>

<p>After that I went into the Topkapi Palace, a huge site with pretty magnificent
grounds showing off the lovely mix of colours, patterns and architecture from
the periods when it had been inhabited.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11438719436/in/set-72157638802576105" title="Inside Topkapi Palace by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3681/11438719436_ce00c5f3c8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Inside Topkapi Palace" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside Topkapi Palace</em></a></span></p>

<p>I had a slight misunderstanding about the museum card, thinking it allowed me to
enter any of the museums for the three days it was valid, but it turned out it
only let you into each place once during those 3 days. To get to the Harem you
needed to already be inside the Topkapi Palace, so my plan to look around the
palace that afternoon and come back and check out the Harem got changed up and I
had to rush a bit through both to fit them into the already late afternoon.</p>

<p>The Haram consisted of some beautifully decorated quarters for the sultan, his
family and his concubines, but quite a number of interesting sounding areas (for
example the concubine baths) were completely closed off for restoration works.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11439176553/in/set-72157638802576105" title="Stained glass by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5528/11439176553_9bf4f48f40_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Fancy much?" class="img-responsive"><em>Fancy much?</em></a></span></p>

<p>One evening in Istanbul I decided to find a barber to get my beard trimmed
properly since it was pretty long at this point, and extremely shaggy. It was
probably the first time I&#8217;d paid a barber in about a decade.  The guy was very
thorough, thinning the sides and giving it a much better shape. He also shaved
my head with a straight razor, trimmed my nose hairs, my eye brows, and my ear
hairs, then waved a lit cotton tip soaked in something flammable around my ears
to burn off hair and wax. Afterwards I felt the neatest I had in many months.</p>

<p>On our last day there I went into the Hagia Sofia &#8220;Museum&#8221;, a huge building that
used to be a mosque. Calling it a museum was a bit of stretch because there
wasn&#8217;t really any much information about anything to be found inside. It was in
the same realm of size as the Blue Mosque, but felt for more vast and open
without all the wires and lights that cluttered up the Blue Mosque.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11439287474/in/set-72157638802576105" title="Inside Hagia Sophia by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3770/11439287474_4af0ac4192_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Inside Hagia Sophia" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside Hagia Sophia</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went out for a nice dinner on that last night and had our first Testi kebabs.
They&#8217;re a kebab that is cooked in a clay pot shaped like a vase, which during
the serving they make quite a show of turning the pot upside down with foil over
the top to keep everything inside, and then smashing the bottom of the pot off
carefully and then pouring the casserole out through the smashed off bottom.
They&#8217;d obviously been slow cooked for a very long time as the meat was so
incredibly tender it just felt apart on your fork, and the whole thing was super
delicious.</p>

<p>We were up before sunrise the next day to catch our flight to Goreme in
Capadocia, home of the fairy chimneys and hundreds of hot air balloons.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s 2014 and you&#8217;ll probably notice things look quite a bit different. I&#8217;ve
done what any good procrastinator would do when faced with little to no internet
and a lot of time to spare; I&#8217;ve completely revamped my blog so it&#8217;s nicer to
work with when I dont have internet, and have a copy that works without relying
on the existance of tumblr. (Sorry Amanda, I bet you thought I was going to
actually have written a post about Turkey at last :P)</p>

<p>Anyhow, comments from the old site should migrate over in the next 24 hours. Let
me know if you notice anything that looks broken.</p>

      <p>Breaking chronology for a change because I love these photos so much.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of old abandoned things in Berlin; there are entire sites dedicated to what&#8217;s out there, how to get in, what are the risks, etc. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated seeing old places that would have been someone&#8217;s home or workplace for years on end, but one day left to rot and let nature start reclaiming. I love seeing photos of such places, and the few abandoned places I have been very cool experiences.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11224500606/" title="Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7392/11224500606_cf5f0ec5de_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance" class="img-responsive"><em>Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the places in Berlin that really sounded unique was an old theme park, the Spreepark, which existed way back in the days of East German, becoming more westernised after the reunification of Germany. It was abandoned in 2001 and has since become thoroughly derelict. I read that you can get in to the site through gaps in the fence, but there are often security you have to watch out for, possibly with dogs, so when I found out that they&#8217;d started doing tours of the place on Sundays I decided to take the easy way out and pay to get in there legitimately.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11224505586/" title='Oranised tours, not truely "abandoned" anymore by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr'><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5525/11224505586_8ede3a76f0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt='Oranised tours, not truely "abandoned" anymore' class="img-responsive"><em>Oranised tours, not truely &#8220;abandoned&#8221; anymore</em></a></span></p>

<p>The tour was in German, and boy did they have a lot of information/stories/something to share. Each time we&#8217;d stop somewhere the guide would talk for like 20 minutes, and to be honest the first two places we stopped weren&#8217;t intrinsically interesting or photogenic, so all of the non-German speakers started to drift off further along to get a sneak peak until eventually I was no longer &#8220;just a bit ahead&#8221; but instead I was off exploring by myself proper the way I really wanted to do it anyway.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something vibe killing about being in a group of 40 people at somewhere &#8220;abandoned&#8221;, so I was very happy to get lost and find myself in parts of the park where I couldn&#8217;t see or hear another person. The one sounds were the wind, the birds and the creaking of the old Ferris wheel as the wind made it turn. Very eery!</p>

<p>One security guy was still doing laps of the park on a bike, but I managed to avoid him for the most part. The one time I did get spotted by him I was actually near some other people, and because we had the tour passes on he just friendlily herded us back to the tour group. That pass was pretty much a get out of jail free card! Soon enough I wandered off again to explore without the herd.</p>

<p>There was an old flume ride, now with the track mostly full of leaves.</p>

<p>There were swan boats that had managed to free themselves from the tyranny of their traditional canals, now floating free next to pirate ships.</p>

<p>This lonely old couch, left to rot in the middle of an old market square, would have some good stories to tell about how it even got there.</p>

<p>Every single bridge I could find to the island with the wheel on it had rotten through and collapsed, so I never did get to see the base of it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always intrigued by the final series of events when a place gets abandoned. Did they know at the time that they weren&#8217;t going to return, or was it just closing for a short period? How did all the swan boats get out of their canal? Where were all they dinosaurs originally, and why?</p>

      <p>As we approached Rwanda, the terrain started getting a lot more hilly than that of Uganda. We got to the border and queued up to hand in our passports and get our visa, all the while with locals trying to cut in line. I got given some minor grief over not having printed out the acceptance letter for my visa. I did have it in digital form and the letter has a giant bar code that one would assume they&#8217;d scan, but apparently it&#8217;s easier to put bar codes on letters than it is to put bar code scanners at the border.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914653853/" title="Welcome to the republic of Rwanda by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7305/10914653853_b847da95c6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Welcome to the republic of Rwanda" class="img-responsive"><em>Welcome to the republic of Rwanda</em></a></span></p>

<p>This was our single slowest border crossing, taking over 90 minutes to get some simple ink stamp &#8220;visas&#8221; put in our passports. Most of the truck was starving by the time we finally got our passports back, but there was still more driving to do before we arrived in Ruhengeri and stopped to make lunch. We were staying in dorm rooms so nobody had to put up tents for a change!</p>

<p>The next morning we were all up early for the big day, gorilla trekking! We were all ready to go well before the sun was up. I&#8217;d woken to hear heavy rain during the night which had me a bit concerned about what the weather might be like but once the sun came up the weather stabilised as just mostly overcast.</p>

<p>The gorillas are only allowed one hour of visiting time per day, during which a group of a maximum of 8 people can come and see them. I think there was something like 10 groups of gorillas that tourists are allowed to trek to see, which means only about 80 people get to experience this on any given day. During the rest of the day there are people employed to track them from a distance to keep an eye on them and protect them from poachers until quite late at night, coming back again early in the morning to figure out where they have moved to.</p>

<p>We started with a very bumpy 40 minute drive to a village where the trek to our gorilla group began, from where we walked for another 40 or so minutes through farms, up the hill to the start of the national park and the mountain jungle.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914352185/" title="Walking through the village by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2833/10914352185_441f03a626_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Walking through the village" class="img-responsive"><em>Walking through the village</em></a></span></p>

<p>Our guide was apparently the best in Rwanda and had won an award to prove it. He later told us that he&#8217;s taken Bill Gates and his family trekking the gorillas, along with some other famous people I didn&#8217;t recognise. He had a very over-the-top level of enthusiasm that I thought felt pretty insincere, but as the day went on though, either I warmed up to him, or he started to drop the act and began behaving more genuinely; maybe it was just too early in the morning enough sleep?</p>

<p>In addition to our guide we had some armed escorts, I like to think they were there to protect us from the wildlife, but it&#8217;s also possible they were there to protect us from guerrillas from Congo. Eek!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914496524/" title="Walking up the hill through farms by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7305/10914496524_e935218b49_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Walking up the hill through farms" class="img-responsive"><em>Walking up the hill through farms</em></a></span></p>

<p>Along the way our guide spotted a chameleon, the first one I&#8217;ve ever seen. It was very cool to see to see it move it&#8217;s eyes independently and a whole lot smaller than I had expected. I always thought they were quite large, but all the ones we saw were tiny. It also turns out they take quite a while to change colour, so even though a few of us got to have him walk along our arms we didn&#8217;t get to see him change colour.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914509344/" title="Chameleon! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5497/10914509344_14ab642bee_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chameleon!" class="img-responsive"><em>Chameleon!</em></a></span></p>

<p>After another 40 more minutes of trekking up along a fairly well established path through the national park we were finally near enough to where the gorillas were to go &#8220;off path&#8221;. The forest around this point was extremely thick scrub consisting largely of stinging nettles, which were hacked and slashed at with machetes to make a narrow path for us. I can tell you for certain now that stinging nettles are able to sting through right through denim. If you&#8217;re ever doing this trek I&#8217;d highly recommend getting some gaiters to protect your legs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914527274/" title="Into the thicker scrub by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2882/10914527274_d5b4ce72f6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Into the thicker scrub" class="img-responsive"><em>Into the thicker scrub</em></a></span></p>

<p>We followed the newly slashed path for about 10 minutes before we sighted our first gorilla off in the distance.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914394185/" title="First gorilla sighting by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7354/10914394185_d517bb0755_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="First gorilla sighting" class="img-responsive"><em>First gorilla sighting</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was quite a long way off but everyone was instantly pretty excited, but we were hurried along by the guide. Suddenly we look to our left and there&#8217;s another gorilla right next to us, probably only 3-4 meters away at most. He&#8217;s there just chilling, eating stuff. He looks over at us briefly but then goes back to chewing and ignoring us.</p>

<p>We continue on into the scrub and found a few more sitting around eating.</p>

<p>We then came across the silverback of the group and got a few distant photos before he moved on.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914746563/" title="Scratching by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3685/10914746563_c6372c09e3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Big boss scratching" class="img-responsive"><em>Big boss scratching</em></a></span></p>

<p>A mother gorilla with its baby came walking right towards us; we stood still as we had been instructed to do and they walked right past me, actually brushing against me. It was magical to be in such close proximity to such powerful creatures and have them seem to completely unfazed by our presence.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914449615/" title="Baby going for a ride by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3745/10914449615_45e4a3c181_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Baby going for a ride" class="img-responsive"><em>Baby going for a ride</em></a></span></p>

<p>We followed them to where they were going and found 8 gorillas lazing together. A few of them were grooming one another, while the silverback was lying back with his legs spread, a very dignified position for the big boss.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914782213/" title="What are you looking at? by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2847/10914782213_0f52e37ed9_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="What are you looking at?" class="img-responsive"><em>What are you looking at?</em></a></span></p>

<p>The little baby was here as well, climbing all over the others, falling down, and rolling down the hill. So very cute.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10914794413/" title="Band of gorillas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2835/10914794413_814759ed4d_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Band of gorillas" class="img-responsive"><em>Band of gorillas</em></a></span></p>

<p>We found the &#8220;Vice president&#8221; silverback off to the side with one of the females, apparently trying to get her to &#8220;service him&#8221; while the big boss wasn&#8217;t looking. Very naughty!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m told we saw every gorilla from the group we trekked to, 18 in total, although with them moving around during our visit I didn&#8217;t even attempt to count them for myself. It was definitely a very special experience that I feel quite privileged to have been able to take part in. It&#8217;s easily sitting at No. 1 on my list of best things I&#8217;ve gotten to see or do so far and I&#8217;d highly recommend it to anyone who has the chance.</p>

<p>After our hour was up we had to leave and start the very long walk back to the jeeps, along which we found lots more chameleons on the walk back, some of them extremely tiny and in a variety of colours!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10915394443/" title="Chameleon! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5513/10915394443_67e7d59cdc_c.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Chameleon!" class="img-responsive"><em>Chameleon!</em></a></span></p>

<p>Once we got back to camp we spent the afternoon consuming some well earned celebratory beers.</p>

<p>The following day we made the short drive from Ruhengeri to Kigali through the mountains; it was Amazing to see how steep the land some of the farmers were utilizing was. I&#8217;ve never seen crops growing on such steep land every before!</p>

<p>We stopped in to have a look around Hotel Des Mille Collines, the actual hotel that the Hotel Rwanda story was based on. It was pretty surreal to think of the 1000s of refuges holed up in there while people just outside the fences that wanted to kill them. Today it&#8217;s all so modern and ritzy which it hard to comprehend that it&#8217;s the same place.</p>

<p>Next stop was the Kigali Genocide Museum which was incredibly educational, with great coverage of the atrocities that went on in Rwanda during those 100 days in 1993, and a exhibition upstairs covered another 5 genocides: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide">The Armenian genocide</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia">Cambodia under the Khemer Rouge</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_Genocide">The  Namibian Genocide</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War">Kosovo</a>. Some of these I&#8217;d known about and others I had no idea. Humans can be such horrible creatures.</p>

<p>The most chilling thing I learned was that the number of UN troops involved in the evacuation of UN personal from Rwanda would have been enough to have stopped the genocide, and yet they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>To get back to Nairobi from Rwanda meant three or four long drive days, back-to-back, punctuated with a few interesting stops.</p>

<p>The first night we stopped at Lake Mburo for a night of camping on the side of the lake, full of hippos. That evening while making dinner we have a number of very bold warthogs come sniffing around in the camp kitchen, only to be shoo&#8217;ed off back Mash swinging a chair at them. Cheeky buggers!</p>

<p>Finally on our 4th and final land crossing of the Equator we stopped for lunch and were able to take some photos.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10915435514/" title="Equator excitment by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5535/10915435514_2a3d23bc75_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Equator excitment" class="img-responsive"><em>Equator excitment</em></a></span></p>

<p>We were stopped by police as we went through Nakuru, who insisted we were speeding even though there are speed bumps on the road every 100 meters or so. We were forced to go to the police station with the cop to &#8220;sort it out&#8221;. It was another of those times when a bribe is going to be faster, cheaper and easier than following official process which would have required showing up in court with the possibility of a $1000 fine, so again we paid another $300 bribe in Kenya.</p>

<p>While at the police station, other overland trucks started showing up, all faced with the same accusations. The level of corruption in Kenya leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but on the up-side, someone on the truck was really sick, and this unplanned stop gave them a chance to visit a travel clinic and get fixed up.</p>

<p>I chose to go mountain biking in Hell&#8217;s Gate National Park, one of the parks that the Lion King is said to take inspiration from. It&#8217;s a stunning place to see, with lots of spectacular cliffs and canyons.</p>

<p>We left the bikes to venture down into the gorge which involved walking along next to some quite big drops, but it was worth it to get to see down the bottom.</p>

<p>When we finally made it back to Nairobi, a few of us went to visit the Giraffe sanctuary, where you could feed a giraffe from your mouth so it looked like they were giving you a kiss.</p>

<p>For out last evening in Africa we went and hung out with Pete and Deb one last time at the apartment they had rented. It was a lovely relaxed evening of pizza, drinks, and nature documentaries. Those two are total champions, so lovely and hospitable. I will definitely need to make a trip to Sydney to visit them one day when I&#8217;m finally back in Australia.</p>

<p>We headed to the airport after midnight for our flight to Turkey, which left at 3:45am. I was so tired that I slept sitting upright in a plastic chair, and when I was finally on the plane and I was asleep again before takeoff.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to put into words what it&#8217;s like out on the streets of Africa. They&#8217;re like no other place I&#8217;ve been. Towards the end of the trip I started taking a LOT of photos out the window in the hope it might capture even just a small fraction of the weird and wonderful things you see out the truck window. Click the photo to go to the full flickr set. Feel free to be distracted, and not notice that I haven&#8217;t posted about gorillas yet too :P</p>

      Uganda - White Water Rafting, Tracking Chimps and Teaching Orphans

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>After crossing into Uganda our first stop was Jinja, the second largest city in Uganda and its unofficial extreme sports capital. We had a free day here to do whatever activities took our fancy; some people went and played mini-golf, some went and played regular golf, but I opted for white water rafting down the White Nile.</p>

<p>All up there was seven people from our Dragoman group who went along, who with our American guide Tyler made up a full raft of people. We got taken to the &#8220;put in&#8221; point where we were given some breakfast, sorted out with high-flotation life vests and paddles and then were led down to our raft for some basic training, which involved things like paddling in time, turning, getting down low in the raft, flipping the raft and climbing back in. It was all pretty straightforward stuff and the water was a lovely refreshing temperature. A lot of people struggled to get back into the raft unassisted, but I surprised myself by being one of the ones who could! I can&#8217;t even do a single chin up, but I guess climbing back into a raft probably uses a lot of the same muscles that I built up last year being stuck on crutches for nearly 6 months.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421378166/" title="Our rafting group by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7312/10421378166_c1c6dd755d_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Our rafting group" class="img-responsive"><em>Our rafting group</em></a></span></p>

<p>The first rapid of the day was one of the most fun and memorable ones, it was basically a three metre waterfall drop off, followed closely by two more pools of rapids. We went down the waterfall, which felt like a theme park flume log ride on steroids, then paddled as hard as we could for the bigger pool of rapids but the current was too strong and we ended up going down the less turbulent path.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421394005/" title="IMG_9312.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5507/10421394005_3e123c7a49_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Weeeeeeeee!" class="img-responsive"><em>Weeeeeeeee!</em></a></span>
</p>
White water rapids are rated on a grading scale from one to five, with five being the biggest rapids, and we were told that all of the rapids we were going through that day would be between grade three to five. Perfect for someone like me who&#8217;s never done it before :) It&#8217;s not actually as scary as it sounds, because the White Nile river flow is very high volume, that means the rapids are really big, but they&#8217;re also really deep so there&#8217;s much less chance of coming into contact with rocks. Lots more exciting and safer to boot!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421405434/" title="IMG_9380.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7414/10421405434_01c185db99_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Lots of white water" class="img-responsive"><em>Lots of white water</em></a></span>
</p>
During the day we went through eight rapids in total, and having never been rafting before I was a bit surprised how much calm floating down the river was involved between most of them. When after the first two rapids Tyler told us we had about 45 minutes until the next rapid I initially thought he was joking. There was plenty of opportunities for us to jump in the river and just float along next to the raft.</p>

<p>On the third rapid of the day the water surged right as we got into the biggest part of the rapid and flipped the whole raft. Finding myself suddenly underwater like that for the first time, I instantly forgot everything we were told about holding onto paddle and lost it right away. I tried to surface but kept coming up under the raft and its baffles. I started to panic a bit, but managed to calm myself down and realise that I can easily hold my breath for more than a few seconds, so I held my breath and fumbled my way to one of the sides of the raft and grabbed onto the rope. I struggled to keep my head above water while we were still in the rapids, but once we were past them it there was a pretty awesome wave of feeling alive!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421420636/" title="Past the point of no return by Lucas the nomad"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7376/10421420636_7e27343f46_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Past the point of no return" class="img-responsive"><em>Past the point of no return</em></a></span>
</p>
I think pretty much everyone else who was doing it for the first time had similar experiences, many lost paddles were retrieved for us by the safety canoe guys.</p>

<p>We were told how a dam that was built two years earlier has changed the river a lot. None of the old rapids still exist, and new ones have formed. We&#8217;re told that it used to be the best white water rafting rapids in the world before the dam was built, the &#8220;put in&#8221; used to be at the actual campsite that we were staying at, but now the river running past that area is significantly deeper and there&#8217;s no rapids along there at all, hence having to drive 40 minutes in the morning. I still thought it was fantastic fun, but it would have been great to be able to compare it to how it used to be.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421438276/" title="IMG_9401.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7365/10421438276_96ded49a0f_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Riding the waves" class="img-responsive"><em>Riding the waves</em></a></span>
</p>
On the last rapid of the day we were told that if we didn&#8217;t get flipped anyway, Tyler would give the ok and we could all jump out into the surging white water if we wanted to. It was an awesome feeling being in the tumultuous water, this time being well clear of the boat. It felt like being in a giant washing machine, with the water dragging you in every direction, rapidly one after another. It really gave you an appreciation for the raw power of the river.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421446195/" title="IMG_9427.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2853/10421446195_ed5faa99a5_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Everyone made it back in one piece" class="img-responsive"><em>Everyone made it back in one piece</em></a></span>
</p>
Next point of interest was in the Budongo forest, where we went in with guides to track the chimpanzees that live there. The group was split in two since only 12 people are allowed in the forest at once, which was further split into two groups of 6 with a guide each. I thought that the forest felt quite a lot like the Australian rainforest around the area where I grew up on the Far North Coast of NSW.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10440627725/" title="Chimp tracking by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2866/10440627725_849ae02d38_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Chimp tracking" class="img-responsive"><em>Chimp tracking</em></a></span>
</p>
Not long after entering the forest we heard chimp sounds off in the distance, and saw several fresh nests that they apparently make to sleep in at night and use only once. After walking for a while longer we heard more chimp calls coming from behind us and realised we&#8217;d passed them somehow.</p>

</p>
We headed back and found 6-7 chimps walking along one of the tracks away from us, one carrying a baby on it&#8217;s back. One of them split off from the group and we got to watch it climb up a tree and eat some sort of fruit, dropping the seeds down just in front of us.</p>

</p>
We tracked down another one that was just sitting on the forest floor who seemed to be having something to eat and generally lazing about in the sun and spent quite a while watching.</p>

</p>
The forest was generally too thick and we were too far away to get great unobstructed photos, but it was really cool to get to see the chimpanzees in their natural habitat, with some of their movements and behaviours seeming so close to human.</p>

<p>The next place of note was Queen Elizabeth the Second National Park. We went on a game drive here and saw some lions and gazelles and stuff, but nothing as cool as what we&#8217;d already seen. At one point we stopped in a village in the park by the lake, and got out to have a closer look at some hippos near the shore. Steve warned us not to get too close, but didn&#8217;t specify how close. The general consensus was that &#8220;inside a hippo&#8221; was probably too close, but otherwise people were pretty fearless going right up to the edge of the water.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10440658854/" title="Hippo foot print by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7333/10440658854_472cded8e8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Hippo foot print" class="img-responsive"><em>Hippo foot print</em></a></span>
</p>
The highlight for us was a sunset cruise which closely followed along one bank of the river (o channel between two lakes? I&#8217;m not certain). It was probably the most densely packed period of animal watching we got to do all trip. We saw countless hippos and tons of exotic birds, crocodiles, buffalo and countless other critters. </p>

</p>
We saw one hippo &#8220;mark its territory&#8221; by pooping while helicopter-ing it&#8217;s tail around, with bits flying everywhere. An interesting technique to say the least.</p>

</p>
There were lots of old male buffalo, sitting in the water that had apparently been chased away from their herds by the younger, stronger males. This is sort of like retirement for them, although they can sometimes force their way back into a herd.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10440781995/" title="Retired buffalo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2867/10440781995_6735f21dfc_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Retired buffalo" class="img-responsive"><em>Retired buffalo</em></a></span>
</p>
And we got to see lots of hippo yawns, enough to actually get a decent &#8220;postcard&#8221; photo at last!</p>

</p>
At camp that night there were a lot of hippos running around at night and eating near the tents, waking people up and terrifying them. I think I heard some noises off in the distance as I was getting to sleep, but being a heavy sleeper I managed to miss most of the commotion.</p>

<p>The last stop for us in Uganda (for this entry at least), was at Lake Bunyonyi where we stayed at a very scenic camp ground next to a very large and interesting lake. It has nearly 30 islands, its surface is nearly 2000 metres above sea level, and it&#8217;s stupidly deep. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Bunyonyi">Wikipedia says it&#8217;s rumoured to be between 44 metres (which seems like it should be shallow enough to prove or disprove) and 900 meters (now we&#8217;re talking!)</a>. The was a sign on the bank that claims it&#8217;s 6,500 feet deep, or about 2000 meters, and since Wikipedia only lists &#8220;rumoured depths&#8221;, I&#8217;m going with that since the sign is more of a citation than the Wikipedia page has.</p>

</p>
While there we went on a little tour though a local village, where we met a woman that our local guide described as &#8220;a crazy old lady&#8221; that didn&#8217;t speak a word of English, but was very excited to meet everyone, giving everyone a squeeze on the butt, women got a good boob squeeze and men with beards got a stroking. The whole thing was very amusing.</p>

</p>
We also visited a school for orphans between 3-8 years old, run by <a href="http://www.littleangelsuganda.org/">Little Angels Uganda</a>. We sat in on a class doing lessons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and spelling. We even got to get up do a bit of teaching ourselves, and nearly everything that happened in the class was followed by a song all the kids sang: &#8220;(name), you&#8217;re so good and precious&#8221;. It was pretty adorable.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10441045543/" title="Back in school again by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3741/10441045543_bcab45d4fa_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Back in school again" class="img-responsive"><em>Back in school again</em></a></span>
</p>
After class there was more singing and dancing out in the playground, largely led by a very confident little girl with a good sense of rhythm. The kids seemed quite curious about my beard, which led to me being picked to go into their circle to try and dance along with them, showing the world that I have zero rhythm :P</p>

<p>We then helped serve up some lunch for the children consisting of bread, bananas, rice, porridge, and orange drink. During lunch the teachers ran a sort of spelling bee, where if the kids spelt our words they got an extra piece of fruit. Seemed like a good motivator for learning.</p>

<p>We made our way back to camp in dugout canoes, which felt like they might flip at any moment. I have to admit I feared a bit for my electronics until I was standing on land again.</p>

<p>That last night in Uganda we set up a mini-cinema around Steve&#8217;s laptop and watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395169/">Hotel Rwanda</a>, which is almost like an African Schindler&#8217;s list. I&#8217;ll admit my knowledge of the full extent of what happened in Rwanda way back when I was a child was pretty lacking, having a bit of context the night before we were crossing into Rwanda worked out perfectly for me.</p>

<p>The next day we were headed on to Rwanda for the trip highlight, tracking the mountain gorillas, but you&#8217;ll probably have to wait months to read about that at the rate I&#8217;m going writing this stuff up :P Also, if you&#8217;re interested there&#8217;s loads more photos for each blog post up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/sets">Flickr</a> (and Facebook), but these posts are probably already way too photo-heavy.</p>
