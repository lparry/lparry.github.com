<p>I&#8217;d planned to arrive in San Francisco about ten days before Burning Man to give
myself plenty of time before hand to sort out all the preparations I would need
to make to survive a week in the desert. However I messed up and assumed I would
be able to figure out accommodation close to when I got there. By the time I did
try and book somewhere, I couldn&#8217;t find anywhere to stay that was going to be
much less than USD$150 a night. This led to a lot of stress!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/20378247679/in/dateposted-public/" title="Chad, Sarah and Me"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5636/20378247679_89bef5afbd_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Chad, Sarah and Me" class="img-responsive"><em>Chad, Sarah and Me</em></a></span></p>

<p>I contacted anyone and everyone I could think of that lived in the bay area,
trying to find someone who had a couch I could stay on for a while, and I was
saved by Sarah, Rachel&#8217;s sister who I met in Guatemala. Her and her husband Chad
had just bought a condo, were in the process of moving in from their old place
and were happy to have me come stay in their new spare room.</p>

<p>Chad is even a bit of a Burning Man veteran, he&#8217;s been going for a long time and
now volunteers as a ranger each year, so it was fantastic for me to have someone
who could answer my questions about what was and wasn&#8217;t important stuff to take,
and tell me tales of past years events.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/20395641339/in/dateposted-public/" title="River saying hello to the camera"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/640/20395641339_7e0870d804_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="River saying hello to the camera" class="img-responsive"><em>River saying hello to the camera</em></a></span><script async="" src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Sarah and Chad&#8217;s condo is a beautiful big place right near the mission district,
really spacious and light. They have an awesome dog named River, an American
bulldog, who seemed to take an instant shine to me, howling with excitement when
I arrived, wagging her tail like mad and trying to jump up on me. Such a lovely
natured dog!</p>

<p>Since Sarah and Chad were still in the process of moving, I got to be helpful by
going and helping to pack some boxes at the old place (just two blocks away),
and moving them down and up stairs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19900195976/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Golden Gate bridge being covered by Karl the fog by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/434/19900195976_fd83fca6ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Golden Gate bridge being covered by Karl the fog" class="img-responsive"><em>Golden Gate bridge being covered by Karl the fog</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the nights not long after I arrived, there was a 15th anniversary
screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a> happening at the Castro theatre that
Sarah and Chad were going to, so I grabbed a ticket and went along too. The
Castro Theatre is one of those historic old places that only plays arthouse
movies and cult classics, and for the 15th anniversary of Office Space, they
actually had Stephen Root (who played Milton with the Swingline stapler) there
to talk at the beginning and do a Q&amp;A afterwards. It was just as funny as it was
when it came out, and it felt kind of surreal to be in a theatre full of people
who loved the movie so much and even a member of the cast!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19931147451/in/set-72157653894545484" title="SF Grafitti by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/479/19931147451_9a9fa9501f_c.jpg" width="800" height="730" alt="SF Grafitti" class="img-responsive"><em>SF Grafitti</em></a></span></p>

<p>As I mentioned before, I&#8217;d planned to get to SF early to sort out my Burning Man
prep, but between booking my flights and arriving, I had actually been lucky
enough to be put in contact with a guy named Peter from the theme camp I was
going to stay with, who had an RV and was looking for someone to share it with.
This was a huge blessing, as it saved me blowing a bunch of money on a tent,
camp mat, sleeping bag, etc, that I would only have to give away afterward
anyway. Even more awesome was Peter&#8217;s offer to handle acquisition of food and
water in exchange for money and a shopping list. My stresses about how I was
going to transport a weeks worth of food and water in when I was arriving by bus
were completely solved! I can&#8217;t thank Pete enough.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19737829488/in/set-72157653894545484" title="These were the best Oreos ever by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3805/19737829488_2c0f057a53_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="These were the best Oreos ever. I love you America!" class="img-responsive"><em>These were the best Oreos ever. I love you America!</em></a></span></p>

<p>With so much of the prep taken care of already, I got to spend a lot of my time
in San Francisco seeing touristy stuff instead. I also did do a lot of buying
stuff on Amazon , making good use of an Amazon Prime trial for free fast
shipping. After so long in Central America without easy access to a lot of
things, having things arrive at the house after just a few clicks online felt
like I was living in the future!</p>

<p>One day I went over to check out the SF cable car museum. I&#8217;d planned to
actually take the cable car up Nob hill from Powell and Market, but the lines to
get on were absurd so I just walked up instead. The museum was pretty neat, it&#8217;s
actually in the same building where they pull the cables from and you can see
the giant motors and the big wheels they use to pull the cables through the
network.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19303206874/in/set-72157653894545484" title="The wheels that pull the cable for SFs cable cars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/540/19303206874_ea9fb82bcb_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The wheels that pull the cable for SFs cable cars" class="img-responsive"><em>The wheels that pull the cable for SFs cable cars</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a subterranean bit where you can see how they manage to navigate
the cable around corners, and a lot of information about how the drivers have to
release the cable at certain corners or intersections in order to pass other
cables that cross the one that&#8217;s pulling their car. It was all really
interesting to see and learn about.</p>

<p>There was a big section of the museum about the 1906 earthquakes that flattened
most of the city, destroying a lot of the old cable car lines, but also starting
fires while simultaneously knocking out the water pressure, leaving the fire
department unable to fight the fires and huge areas of the city just burning to
the ground. It&#8217;s incredible to think that San Francisco has been completely
devastated by earthquakes twice in the same century.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19925926025/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Berkley campus by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/385/19925926025_65465c91ba_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="Berkley campus" class="img-responsive"><em>Berkley campus</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day I went over to the East Bay and had a walk around Berkeley, checking
out the very imposing building of the university there and some of the trendy
streets nearby.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19304964153/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Berkley pier by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/463/19304964153_51ec05bee1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Berkley pier from the far end" class="img-responsive"><em>Berkley pier from the far end</em></a></span></p>

<p>Then I headed over to the Berkeley pier, and walked out along it to get another
view of the bay. The pier extends out about a kilometre into the bay, but from
the end of the pier you can see remnants of the old pier which was apparently
nearly 6km long!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19900066716/in/set-72157653894545484" title="California Academy of Science by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/349/19900066716_1627354f86_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="California Academy of Science" class="img-responsive"><em>California Academy of Science</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day I got a bus over to the California Academy of Science museum. It&#8217;s
quite a cool building with a grassy, hilly rooftop, with lots of hardy plants up
there, that insulate the building keeping the temperatures more stable. There&#8217;s
also a bunch of solar panels around the edge providing some of the buildings
power needs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19738160348/in/set-72157653894545484" title="California Academy of Science by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/320/19738160348_16df7f2136_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="California Academy of Science" class="img-responsive"><em>California Academy of Science</em></a></span></p>

<p>Inside the building is split up into various sections about different areas and
topics. The basement houses a fairly large aquarium, with many of the tanks also
being viewable from above. From the top you can see the brightly coloured fish
swimming around, and in a shallow pool there was a number of pretty rays
gliding.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19931180611/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Colourful fish at California Academy of Science by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/382/19931180611_8f38edb6ae_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Colourful fish at California Academy of Science" class="img-responsive"><em>Colourful fish at California Academy of Science</em></a></span></p>

<p>The aquarium was split up between marine and freshwater fish, and then again
into regions of the globe. The prettiest tanks were the two giant marine tanks
for the Phillipines and the California coast. Interesting fact, what they call a
leopard shark in the USA is completely different from a leopard shark back in
Australia.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19899902666/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Octopus in a jar at California Academy of Science by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/303/19899902666_4a430d258c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Octopus in a jar at California Academy of Science" class="img-responsive"><em>Octopus in a jar at California Academy of Science</em></a></span></p>

<p>In the fresh water and swamp section they had some of the biggest freshwater
fish I&#8217;ve ever seen, and probably the biggest in the aquarium. I don&#8217;t recall
the type, but they were enormous. Strange, I never think of fresh water fish as
having any real mass to them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19931190841/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Leafy sea dragons at California Academy of Science by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/270/19931190841_e979c4c038_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Leafy sea dragons at California Academy of Science" class="img-responsive"><em>Leafy sea dragons at California Academy of Science</em></a></span></p>

<p>They had some leafy and weedy sea dragons, along with pot belly seahorses. I
miss those guys from the piers around Port Philip Bay!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19305260263/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Rainforest dome at California Academy of Science by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/549/19305260263_6f1110a0ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rainforest dome at California Academy of Science" class="img-responsive"><em>Rainforest dome at California Academy of Science</em></a></span></p>

<p>There is a big sealed up rainforest zone, which has the temperature and humidity
of a real rainforest. I sped through a good chunk at the start because it was
all the animals I&#8217;d gotten used to seeing regularly in Central America. In the
later parts there were some neat creatures from South America, and lots of tiny
very poisonous pretty frogs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19926261105/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Whale skeleton at California Academy of Science by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/519/19926261105_e4b3898a59_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Whale skeleton at California Academy of Science" class="img-responsive"><em>Whale skeleton at California Academy of Science</em></a></span></p>

<p>There is also a big section about earthquakes, with info about SF&#8217;s big quakes,
and a simulator that roughly shows what it would have been like to be in both of
them. It was kind of cool, but the fear that you get in a real earthquake (like
the one I felt in Xela, in buildings of unknown structural soundness) just
wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19305318023/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Golden Gate poking over the hills by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/281/19305318023_834fc0ce7f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Golden Gate poking over the hills" class="img-responsive"><em>Golden Gate poking over the hills</em></a></span></p>

<p>After I finished up at the museum, I found out you could go up the tower across
the way at the de Young museum and get a good view of the city, so I did.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19739660489/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Alcatraz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/451/19739660489_db09534766_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alcatraz" class="img-responsive"><em>Alcatraz</em></a></span></p>

<p>I wanted to go and see Alcatraz, but I&#8217;d heard you usually have to book at least
a few days in advance, and for the night tours, sometimes months in advance. I
looked into it a few days before I wanted to go and most of the times were
pretty crappy and the night tour was full, but then I looked again the next day
and now there was one ticket available for the night tour, so I booked that.
Glad I procrastinated booking that one or I would have missed out!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19931463481/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Alcatraz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/308/19931463481_8a16e5a6bb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alcatraz" class="img-responsive"><em>Alcatraz</em></a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful weather that day held out into the afternoon, so when I got the
boat went over to Alcatraz I got a great view of the Golden Gate bridge,
followed by a nice loop around the rock itself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19900199966/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Welcome to Alcatraz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3751/19900199966_63a3b1be58_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Welcome to Alcatraz" class="img-responsive"><em>Welcome to Alcatraz</em></a></span></p>

<p>Since it was the night tour, we were given some extra commentary by a live
speaker on the boat over. Once we landed we had another short tour with some
more stories and history about the place, leading us up to prison where we were
given audio guide that led us around the prison, telling us about the guards in
the inmates who had lived there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19739786029/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Entry showers at Alcatraz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/558/19739786029_2317a0173f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Entry showers at Alcatraz" class="img-responsive"><em>Entry showers at Alcatraz</em></a></span></p>

<p>It started in the showers, and then led us up and around through the various
cell blocks, the library, into the administration section, out to the wardens
house (where paused it and ducked over to get another look at the bridge with
the sun set), then back through the cell blocks, past &#8220;time square&#8221; (the prison
clock) and into the mess hall.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19918985892/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Alcatraz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/481/19918985892_b84a88d60e_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Alcatraz" class="img-responsive"><em>Alcatraz</em></a></span></p>

<p>I saw the dummy heads used in the escape of three prisoners, completely with
human hair. Later a guest guide gave a story about that escape, how the guys
involved had worked out there were vents in the maintenance shaft between the
cells, because of one part of the prison that had been remodeled, leaving a vent
showing in open roof.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19303872484/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Alcatraz cells by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/449/19303872484_fba7b33306_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alcatraz cells" class="img-responsive"><em>Alcatraz cells</em></a></span></p>

<p>He told us how they were working painting the ceilings, and claimed that they
wanted to paint the whole way through (inside maintenance shafts too). They
kicked a lot of dust off while there were in there, which then went into
prisoner cells making a lot of people unhappy, and so they were allowed to put
up painters drop sheets, providing them with the cover they needed to work on
their escape.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19305597653/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Alcatraz control room by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/456/19305597653_6cdeba8f60_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alcatraz control room" class="img-responsive"><em>Alcatraz control room</em></a></span></p>

<p>We heard how they&#8217;d steal spoons, since the knives were carefully counted and
one missing would have resulted in everyone having to go through a metal
detector, but spoons weren&#8217;t considered a dangerous weapon. We were told how
they carved out the vents in their rooms, hiding their work with art they had
painted; and how after they escaped, they were never seen again, their bodies
never found. To this day it&#8217;s a mystery as to their fate.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19738609208/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Administration building by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/461/19738609208_8ca1658f05_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Administration building" class="img-responsive"><em>Administration building</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another guide told us a story about the final escape at the prison. A guy who
had always acted like a model prisoner got promoted to the store room. He then
stacked boxes in front of a window until it was well obscured, then spent a year
cutting through the bars inside the window.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19900451196/in/set-72157653894545484" title="Alcatraz by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/267/19900451196_fd37b2bc42_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alcatraz" class="img-responsive"><em>Alcatraz</em></a></span></p>

<p>The outer bars were softer steal, so eventually he made a break for it, cutting
through them in just one night. He then blew up rubber gloves and stuffed them
in his shirt to make himself a floatation device and headed out into the bay,
but he got caught in the tide and missed all the piers he had aimed to end up
at. He ended up landing at Presidio, which was at the time a military base,
where he was recaptured immediately.</p>

<p>Other perks of the night tour were that there were lots more talks and
presentations than normal, and several parts of the prison were open that are
not normally open such as the rec yard and the hospital. Unfortunately, the
talks were all great, and back to back, so I didn&#8217;t actually get much time to
explore the hospital and didn&#8217;t get to the rec yard at all. I would have loved
another 2-3 hours to explore, and a tripod to have a go at some real HDR photos.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things on the night tour was the slamming of the cell doors,
a presentation where they opened and closed the doors of a row of cells, telling
us how that booming sound was specifically designed to communicate to the
prisoners who was in control. There is a big metal cover over the doors
machinery and the doors actually work just fine without it, but nearly silently
instead of the loud booming sounds.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twecNQlzBW4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>They told us that the sound of those doors has been sampled and used in lots of
movies, for example Jurassic Park and The Empire Strikes Back. It&#8217;s a pretty
iconic sound.</p>

<p>The next stop in my whirlwind tour of the northern parts of Guatemala was the
Rio Dulce. I got a bus (an actual comfortable coach style bus with reclining
seats and everything), that left an hour late at Flores, but still somehow got
me to Rio Dulce early. I didn&#8217;t think this was possible in Guatemala so it was a
very welcome surprise!</p>

<p>I got a boat from the town to the hostel I was staying at, the Kangaroo Hostel,
a nice little place accessible only by the water, run by a very Aussie Australian
and his Mexican wife. It was a little weird to be in Guatemala, surrounded by
kitsch Aussie memorabilia, but the menu had some pretty good Mexican options on
it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/18501188978/in/set-72157654310348526" title="P1220933.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8897/18501188978_703a4d22da_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Castillo San Felipe" class="img-responsive"><em>Castillo San Felipe</em></a></span></p>

<p>My travel agent had booked me on a boat trip along the river to go out to
Livingston on the Caribbean coast and back. The boat ride was pretty nice; so
lush and green on either side. First we looped around to see Castillo San
Felipe.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/18689003105/in/set-72157654310348526" title="P1220954.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8881/18689003105_6c501d84ab_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="A girl coming to try and sell us trinkets" class="img-responsive"><em>A girl coming to try and sell us trinkets</em></a></span></p>

<p>Then a bit later we stopped at a place so little girls could paddle out to us
with canoes full of trinkets to try and sell to us, then further down the diver
we stopped at a place with a hot spring along the edge of the river.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/18068393673/in/set-72157654310348526" title="P1220971.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8834/18068393673_5f2d47a1cb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So pretty and green!" class="img-responsive"><em>So pretty and green!</em></a></span></p>

<p>Finally we got to the part were the river is cutting through the limestone
canyons, which were super steep with loads of beautiful untouched vegetation
growing all over it.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Livingston we had a bunch of black guys come out to meet the
boat shouting &#8220;welcome to Africa&#8221; then trying to take us to hostels. One guy was
even trying to sell us weed.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/18689167105/in/set-72157654310348526" title="P1220993.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/275/18689167105_b03eca5e6b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt='The "beach"' class="img-responsive"><em>The &#8220;beach&#8221;</em></a></span></p>

<p>Livingston itself didn&#8217;t have very much to offer, the town was tiny, dusty and
stinking hot. I went exploring with a newly-wed Israeli couple and we went and
saw two of the nearby beaches. They had dark brown mud-like sand, grass growing
right to the edge, the water was a dirty brown, and there was tons of rubbish
dumped along them. They were more like a polluted river bank, but even less
scenic.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/18501469350/in/set-72157654310348526" title="P1230005.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/331/18501469350_fcfe28df6e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pelicans trying to get an easy lunch" class="img-responsive"><em>Pelicans trying to get an easy lunch</em></a></span></p>

<p>We found a place to have a beer while watching local fishermen circle their
nets, with heaps and heaps of pelicans flying over, looking for an easy lunch.</p>

<p>For lunch we went and tried the local traditional food, Garifuna tapado, a
coconut seafood curry with plantains. It was epic, easily the best part of going
to Livingston for me. There was a whole fried fish, a whole crab split in two
and 6 or so prawns, all in delicious coconut soup.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/18691575921/in/set-72157654310348526" title="IMG_3551.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8861/18691575921_52fe4b78a9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Yachts along the river" class="img-responsive"><em>Yachts along the river</em></a></span></p>

<p>We got the boat back along the river to the hostel and I spent the evening
hanging out with people drinking and eating Mexican food.</p>

<p>The next day I got a bus to Guatemala City to stay the night in a hostel before
my early flight to SF the next day. The hostel was a bit strange, occupying
several separate apartments in an apartment building.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17335751295/in/set-72157651863523397" title="The Pinata district by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8762/17335751295_3691448daf_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The Pinata district" class="img-responsive"><em>The Pinata district</em></a></span></p>

<p>The day of my flight went really smoothly. I got a transfer from my hostel to
the airport with plenty of time to check in; the check-in lines flowed quickly
as did clearing security and immigration. People boarded the plane like they
actually knew what they were doing for a change. We taxied out to the runway and
waited for our slot to take off.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17309817516/in/set-72157651863523397" title="After taxing back to the gate :( by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8896/17309817516_c3a0bbda55_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="After taxing back to the gate :(" class="img-responsive"><em>After taxing back to the gate :(</em></a></span></p>

<p>Then we got told there was a &#8220;light fault&#8221;, and we were taxied back to the gate
where we waited while the engineers checked it out. I was thinking &#8220;what does it
matter if a light isn&#8217;t working for a day time flight?&#8221;, but after about half an
hour they announced that there was problem with an engine and I realised that
&#8220;light fault&#8221; must have meant a warning light in the cockpit was on and it
suddenly sounded much more serious.</p>

<p>After about an hour on the plane we were told the plane wasn&#8217;t going anywhere
and we all de-boarded out into the gate again, where we were led out of the
airport, straight through immigration again without even being stopped, to
collect our bags after which we had to leave the airport entirely and reenter
the departures section of the airport to queue up and be rebooked on new flights.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17128366767/in/set-72157651863523397" title="The line to rebook flights by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8808/17128366767_99b7c28296_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The line to rebook flights" class="img-responsive"><em>The line to rebook flights</em></a></span></p>

<p>The line to rebook the entire flight was horrendously long and slow moving.
United only had two staff on to deal with it, so in the end I was waiting in
line for about four hours, only to be told that because of earlier cancellations
that week they couldn&#8217;t book me to fly tomorrow either, and that I was stuck in
Guatemala City for the next two nights.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17149596009/in/set-72157651863523397" title="Fancy hotel pool by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7759/17149596009_8d6052ec23_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Fancy hotel pool" class="img-responsive"><em>Fancy hotel pool</em></a></span></p>

<p>They booked me into a hotel and gave me some vouchers to buy meals there. The
hotel was pretty nice, far fancier than anywhere else I&#8217;ve stayed on this trip,
but it was in a pretty seedy feeling part of town. I was disappointed to find
out that the vouchers they gave me were for $7 per meal, but the hotel only had
a buffet on offer for lunch and dinner, and the buffet cost $14. Tightwads! I
could have easily eaten for $7 a meal if they&#8217;d given me cash and I&#8217;d gone out
for food.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17149738129/in/set-72157651863523397" title="Plaza fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8830/17149738129_e0e7cda8a5_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Plaza fountain" class="img-responsive"><em>Plaza fountain</em></a></span></p>

<p>Since I had a full day in Guatemala City, I decided to explore the city a bit.
I&#8217;d heard that Guatemala City was like every other capital in Central America, a
big, dirty, dangerous place, with little to offer aside from it&#8217;s airport, but
the central part of the city was actually pretty nice.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17149622929/in/set-72157651863523397" title="Impressive architecture by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8865/17149622929_b1978d4a10_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Impressive architecture" class="img-responsive"><em>Impressive architecture</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went to the huge central park and wandered about looking at the very
impressive façades of old buildings, the palace, the national library and the
cathedral. The architecture was really pretty impressive.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17347665961/in/set-72157651863523397" title="Statue of a bull by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8740/17347665961_b16a167282_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Statue of a bull" class="img-responsive"><em>Statue of a bull</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ended up walking back towards the hotel along 6th Avenida, the pedestrian
street leading out from the central park. The whole strip felt modern, fairly
wealthy and quite safe; It didn&#8217;t really feel like any other part of Guatemala
that I&#8217;d been to. I ended up walking the several kilometres back to the hotel
and even the seedy area the hotel was located in felt pretty safe, even if every
second building seemed to be a strip club. I guess they target the businessmen
using the hotel&#8217;s convention centre.</p>

<p>Attempt two at leaving Guatemala went smoothly, with no issues about having a
passport that was already stamped out of Guatemala and never back in again, and
I was off on my flight to San Francisco to get myself organised before Burning
Man.</p>

      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17225779282/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Temple V by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7657/17225779282_fa99534481_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Temple V at Tikal" class="img-responsive"><em>Temple V at Tikal</em></a></span></p>

<p>After Semuc Champey I headed to Flores, the city closest to Tikal. It was
another long minibus day, 11 hours on the bus, but at least this time I got a
single seat near the door without one in front of it, so I had plenty of legroom
and nobody taking up the space where my shoulders go. I stayed the night in a
hotel where I was the only guest. I really don&#8217;t think the travel agent made
much effort to get me in somewhere cheap as I had to walk past a few different
hostels to get there. I made good use of the air conditioning at least!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The next morning I was picked up by another shuttle that took me in to Tikal
itself. I had opted to stay a night at one of the hotels situated right at the
entrance to the park to enable me to do the sunrise tour without having to get
up at quite such a ridiculous hour to travel the hour or so from Flores to the
park and still make it for sunrise. My room was one of the cheapest ones, so it
was situated away from the fancy part of the hotel near the pool, down a long
path out into the jungle. I think I&#8217;d actually prefer this over the ones in the
upmarket part of the hotel as it was a bit more private feeling and got the
sounds of nature after dark.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17041100829/in/set-72157652039835056" title="The back of Templo del gran jaguar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7676/17041100829_3235030a1c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The back of Templo del gran jaguar" class="img-responsive"><em>The back of Templo del gran jaguar</em></a></span></p>

<p>After checking in I went and did some solo exploring of Tikal. It seemed like a
long walk before I saw any sign of ruins, then suddenly I was next to an
enormous pyramid!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17041182279/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Hard to even identify that this is an unrestored temple by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8692/17041182279_9d42cf472e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Hard to even identify that this is an unrestored temple" class="img-responsive"><em>Hard to even identify that this is an unrestored temple</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was amazing to see the scale of the site and the structures on it. Even more
so when you realise pretty much every hill you see is actually an unrestored
structure of some sort or another.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17226783401/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Maler's Palace? by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7657/17226783401_45ba662612_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Maler's Palace" class="img-responsive"><em>Maler&#8217;s Palace</em></a></span></p>

<p>The structures themselves weren&#8217;t particularly imagination provoking for me.
They&#8217;re huge, but they just feel like giant piles of bricks. I have trouble
imagining how people would live in them, or guessing what they would use them
for, which makes it hard for me to wonder much about their lives. Maybe I&#8217;ve
just got ruin fatigue, although I&#8217;ve only seen two Mayan ruins so far.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16605028094/in/set-72157652039835056" title="The unrestored side of Temple V by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8790/16605028094_db666e7617_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The unrestored side of Temple V" class="img-responsive"><em>The unrestored side of Temple V</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was interesting to see on Temple V how different the sides that aren&#8217;t
restored look compared to the one that is. The ones that aren&#8217;t restored just
look like very steep hills covered in trees, while the one that is has a giant
staircase surrounded by terraces. The original archaeologists would have needed
much better imaginations than mine to realise what was actually there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17041195609/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Me at Tikal by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8728/17041195609_b65d96c765_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me at the top of Temple IV" class="img-responsive"><em>Me at the top of Temple IV</em></a></span></p>

<p>I climbed up to the top of Temple IV and the view was epic, endless jungle with
the tops of temples poking out here and there. This was the temple that we would
be climbing for the sunrise tour, so I was excited about how pretty this vista
might be.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17226751361/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Half of the Great Plaza by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8719/17226751361_58ae4389d0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Half of the Grand Plaza" class="img-responsive"><em>Half of the Grand Plaza</em></a></span></p>

<p>The Grand Plaza was pretty monumental, surrounded on two sides by enormous
pyramids, and on the other two sides by the acropolis and the palace, littered
with stela and alters.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17225895322/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Templo de las mascaras by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5462/17225895322_39277707d4_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Templo de las mascaras" class="img-responsive"><em>Templo de las mascaras</em></a></span></p>

<p>Since I was in the park overnight anyway, I also decided to go on the hotel&#8217;s
sunset tour which turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. The tour was
supposed to be in English, but the guide&#8217;s English was extremely poor. I noticed
at one point that on his official guide badge it only listed Spanish as the
language he was permitted to provide his services in. This led to it not being
very informative at all, and I got little more from having a guide than I had
from wandering around by myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17227402405/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Unrestored corner of a pyramid by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8768/17227402405_5922bc33a4_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Unrestored corner of a pyramid" class="img-responsive"><em>Unrestored corner of a pyramid</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was a three hour tour, but the guide kept stopping in plazas and giving us 30
minutes of &#8220;free time&#8221; to explore by ourselves while he sat and talked to other
guides. Having already explored most of the site that morning, I felt like this
was pretty crummy. All up the tour was maybe 45 minutes of actual tour and a lot
of waiting.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17039994880/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Sunset happening behind the clouds by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5454/17039994880_4395fa0937_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Sunset happening behind the clouds" class="img-responsive"><em>Sunset happening behind the clouds</em></a></span></p>

<p>For sunset itself, our guide told us that the Acropolis is the best place to
view it, but really it wasn&#8217;t a very good view for a sunset, the Acropolis
itself and Temple II blocked most of the view, Temple IV was tiny and in the
distance. There weren&#8217;t many other people around, so I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s
somewhere better to view it from that all the other groups had gone to, maybe
further into the park meaning a longer walk out.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17227539765/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Amazing clouds by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7695/17227539765_c500a3766e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Amazing clouds" class="img-responsive"><em>Amazing clouds</em></a></span></p>

<p>As the sun came down there were some amazing clouds formations appeared in the
sky and some thunder. They were beautiful when they were off to the south, less
pretty when they blew over and blocked the actual setting of the sun and didn&#8217;t
even give us pretty colours. Ah well, you can&#8217;t always get ideal weather.</p>

<p>After returning from the tour, I showered and then had dinner at the hotel with
a couple from Singapore who love to travel and told me all sorts of great
stories about their travels in Cuba and Columbia. After dinner I walked along
the long path towards my room with my head torch on, and could see hundreds of
little dots reflecting light brightly back at me all over the ground. As I got
close enough to see what they were I found that there were hundreds and hundreds
of wolf spiders just chilling about on the grass and on the path way, so I
walked carefully and tried to avoid stepping anywhere near any of them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17041367049/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Dawn at the top of Temple IV by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7716/17041367049_d75733d95c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Dawn at the top of Temple IV" class="img-responsive"><em>Dawn at the top of Temple IV</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next morning I got up at just before 4am to meet up at the hotel reception
with my sunrise tour group and have a coffee. It was a dark morning and we could
see so many stars out. As we walked the long walk from the hotel over to Temple
IV a fog started to rise, and by the time we climbed the stairs at the back of
the temple to sit up on top of it the fog had truly taken over.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16605114694/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Fog rising, but the sun is already up by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7669/16605114694_283b2698ce_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Fog rising, but the sun is already up" class="img-responsive"><em>Fog rising, but the sun is already up</em></a></span></p>

<p>We waited for ages for it to become light, but the heavy fog meant we couldn&#8217;t
even see the closest temples until the sun was well and truly up, and we never
saw any pretty colours or evidence of the sunrise. Such a tease after being up
so early, especially after it had been so clear earlier. 0 out of 2 solar events
witnessed. Screw you weather!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17039620178/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Part of the lost world by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8811/17039620178_1c2115544e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Part of the lost world" class="img-responsive"><em>Part of the lost world</em></a></span></p>

<p>After the failed sunrise we went on a short tour, and this guide was much better
than the first one. We went over to the Lost World and heard how the structures
were built as a sort of calendar with the sunrise lining up with various
buildings on the longest, middle and shortest days. I wish I&#8217;d had this guide
the first day and could have learnt more about the other areas of the park.</p>

<p>After the tour I headed back to the hotel for breakfast, checked out and stashed
my bags, then went and visited a few of the museums around the entrance of the
park. One of them was super interesting, with lots of historical photos showing
the state that all of the temples were found in (after they&#8217;d be cleared of
trees at least). Interestingly there were photos of some of the temples that now
have massive trees growing out of them that showed they had once been cleared in
the past. It seems irresponsible not to keep them free from trees to prevent
further damage, even if they are not restored.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16607590753/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Crocodile in a pond by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8717/16607590753_ea6cf5b347_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Crocodile in a pond" class="img-responsive"><em>Crocodile in a pond</em></a></span></p>

<p>Wandering near a little lake I saw a sign warning there were crocodiles, so I
spent some time looking and found two of them lurking near the surface. They
were only little fellas, but I still wouldn&#8217;t want one of them biting me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17040271970/in/set-72157652039835056" title="The lake at Flores is also rising by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7726/17040271970_3662fef090_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The lake at Flores is also rising" class="img-responsive"><em>The lake at Flores is also rising</em></a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon I got a shuttle back to Flores where I was spending the night,
but this time I arrived with enough time to actually explore a bit. I tried to
walk around the street that circles the island, but one side was cut off by the
lake where it&#8217;s broken its bank. It seems like there&#8217;s a lot of lakes with
rising water levels in Guatemala.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16605391994/in/set-72157652039835056" title="Big doggie getting a bath by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7652/16605391994_fcf8c3b3dc_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Big doggie getting a bath" class="img-responsive"><em>Big doggie getting a bath</em></a></span></p>

<p>Flores didn&#8217;t really seem like a very interesting place. Everything there was a
hotel, a restaurant or a souvenir shop, with more souvenir shops per square km
than Antigua by a long shot. I was pretty glad I only had the afternoon there,
it seemed like plenty, and I had a bus booked to take me down to Rio Dulce the
next morning.</p>

      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16883863607/in/set-72157651450903798" title="Semuc Champey by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8804/16883863607_84834b2f53_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Semuc Champey" class="img-responsive"><em>Semuc Champey</em></a></span></p>

<p>After Rachel and I parted ways, I had 10 days left before my flight to the USA
and I still hadn&#8217;t been to Semuc Champey, Tikal or the Rio Dulce, so I enlisted
the help of a local travel agent to sort out all the shuttles and buses, places
for me to stay, and tours, to make sure I could fit in all that I wanted to see
and do and still make it back down to Guatemala City in time for my flight.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The shuttle from Antigua to Lanquin was probably the most uncomfortable 10 hours
in all my travels in Central America. The very old minibus was crammed packed
full, even the shitty fold down seats were in use. Even the regular seats were
worn thin with pretty much no padding or structure left to them. It seemed like
pretty much everyone on the shuttle was Israeli, all speaking Hebrew amongst
themselves, so I felt like I was in an little isolated bubble even though I was
crammed in shoulder to shoulder between someone and a very hard window. These
are the experiences nobody thinks about when they&#8217;re romanticising travel.</p>

<p>When I finally got to Lanquin, the shuttle dropped us off and there were pickup
trucks with hyper-aggressive touts trying to get you to come and stay at their
hostels. It seemed like everyone on the bus already had their hostels decided,
so the crowd of idiots swarming the door of the minibus did little other than
block us from getting off. Nobody else from my bus was staying at the same
hostel as me, but I met a nice couple from England, Cathy and Dave, in the back
of the pickup truck taking us to our hostel right at the entrance to Semuc
Champey.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16904991839/in/set-72157651450903798" title="Looking down from the restaurant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8753/16904991839_be21e7857e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Looking down from the hostel restaurant" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking down from the hostel restaurant</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next day I had breakfast and met the group I would be doing the tour with; a
nice mix of British, Canadian, Austrian and Israeli people.</p>

<p>Semuc Champey itself is an incredible natural water feature, where the very fast
flowing Cahabón River has carved out an underground river underneath a large
rock shelf. The rock shelf actually forms a bunch of beautiful aqua coloured
pools that you can swim in. Apparently towards the end of the wet season the
river level can get so high that it rises up and flows both over and underneath
the rock shelf.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17091267205/in/set-72157651450903798" title="Me above Semuc Champey by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8758/17091267205_42a34d1d48_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Me above Semuc Champey" class="img-responsive"><em>Me above Semuc Champey</em></a></span></p>

<p>The tour first took us up a long muddy, quite slippery path to a lookout to see
the view of Semuc Champey that would be on all the post cards. Not having been
in hot humidity in a few months I was entirely not acclimatised and sweated
until everything I was wearing was dripping wet, but it really is a breath
taking view from up there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16883933287/in/set-72157651450903798" title="The river sinking down below Semuc Champey by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7707/16883933287_2b8e2cf65c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The river sinking down below Semuc Champey" class="img-responsive"><em>The river sinking down below Semuc Champey</em></a></span></p>

<p>We then went down a different path that led us to the point where the river
plunges underground. Seeing the force of the water pounding down and the rate it
was flowing was a bit intimidating, with only a rope fence to stop you from
slipping down from the pools we were standing in and falling down into the
turbulent water.</p>

<p>After we&#8217;d checked that out, we went to an area where they had lockable boxes
where we could leave out cameras and clothes, after which we went and swam
in the pools.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16471302003/in/set-72157651450903798" title="Semuc Champey pools by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7658/16471302003_5f4a9f2110_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Semuc Champey pools" class="img-responsive"><em>Semuc Champey pools</em></a></span></p>

<p>Our guide led us around, showing us the best places to jump down from pool to
pool. In one place he showed us a natural slide where there were some slippery
rocks you could sit down on and slide down to the next pool. It was actually
pretty bumpy and jarred the hell out of my poor tail bone. I would rather have
just jumped down from the high ledge he later showed us.</p>

<p>At the other end of the pools we got to see where the river returns out from
underground. Our guide told us that someone had been drunk and tried to go
through the underground route in a tire tube, and that their body had come out
the other side without a head or legs. The jagged rocks and the powerful water
had just ripped the guy apart. Thanks for cleaning up the gene pool guy!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17089914432/in/set-72157651450903798" title="The edges of the pools by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7680/17089914432_f26c84b557_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The edges of the pools" class="img-responsive"><em>The edges of the pools</em></a></span></p>

<p>We we shown some hidden little caves at the edge of one pool, where you were
neck deep in water and had to tilt you head back to keep your mouth above water
in the tiny air space inside. It continued along sideways for a few metres like
that and was surprisingly well lit via light reflections through the water. At
the other end you had to duck down underwater and swim out for 3-4 meters with
blind faith that you would come back out to the open air at the other end.</p>

<p>After out swim we went back to the hostel to have lunch before the second part
of the tour, the Kambuci Caves. The Kambuci caves are a long cave that has been
carved out over thousands of years by the underground river flowing slowly
through it.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the caves we were each given a wax candle with which to light
our way. The river starts off being about waist deep with a rope to help guide
you along the way. There were a few parts where there were ladders to climb up
and over steep rock faces, challenging to climb with a candle in one hand, and
the rock face against the ladder preventing you from putting your foot securely
through the rungs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16903838580/in/set-72157651450903798" title="The edges of the pools by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8703/16903838580_8b30d147e3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The edges of the pools" class="img-responsive"><em>The edges of the pools</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a while we got to parts where the water was too deep to stand, so we were
swimming along with one hand in the air trying to keep our candles dry and lit,
feeling like we were Indiana Jones. We would look for hand holds along to wall
to grab onto and let us be a bit lazier with the swim.</p>

<p>The guide had a waterproof head torch, but I quite enjoyed the challenge of
keeping the candles going, and you could always get a light of someone else if
yours did go out.</p>

<p>We came to a bit where you could climb up a fairly fast flowing waterfall with a
rope, kind of like abseiling in reverse. There was also a ladder next to it for
those who didn&#8217;t want to go the hard way. I almost didn&#8217;t try because I wasn&#8217;t
sure if I would have the strength to do it, but I was pleasantly surprised to
find it much easier than it looked. I did manage to have both contact lens come out
of place from all the water smashing into my face. I managed to blink one back
into position but the other was lost under my eyelid somewhere for the rest of
the day. There was no way up the waterfall without having your candle go out,
but once we were past that part the guide helped us light them all again.</p>

<p>At the end of the caves there was a part where you could climb up and jump down
about 3 meters into a pool of dark black water. The pool was actually a bit
shallow, so you did hit the sandy bottom although not with great force.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16883736257/in/set-72157651450903798" title="The Cahab&#xF3;n River by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7646/16883736257_cae5eb9d72_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The Cahab&#xF3;n River" class="img-responsive"><em>The Cahab&#xF3;n River</em></a></span></p>

<p>After backtracking out of the caves, we set off on the third adventure of the
day. We all got given tire inner tubes and walked back to where the Cahabón
River comes out from underground again, jumped in and floated gently down the
river for about half an hour. A nice relaxing way to round out a great day of
adventuring!</p>

<p>After finishing up in Xela for the second time, Rachel and I headed back to Lake
Atitlan. I&#8217;d wanted to go back and do more yoga in San Marcos and some very
novel scuba diving in the lake itself, and she had enrolled for another week of
Spanish lessons and weaving in San Juan.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I spent most of the week staying back at the same hostel in San Marcos, but this
time I got put in a different dorm. The place was basically a huge two level
cottage with just six single beds, three upstairs and three downstairs. There
was so much space it was crazy! It even had an upstairs balcony.</p>

<p>Charlie, the yoga teacher that I clicked with last time, was away on holidays
the whole week and the replacements were really varied. Some did a very gentle
practice, some were much more challenging. One in particular I had zero faith
in. Part of her practice involved wildly throwing your arms in uncontrolled
windmills as fast as you can&#8230; a great way to fuck up a shoulders in my
experience.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17031608116/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Got enough tuk-tuks? by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8783/17031608116_4d692a28a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Got enough tuk-tuks for a village with barely any roads?" class="img-responsive"><em>Got enough tuk-tuks for a village with barely any roads?</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent some time shopping for some pants in various towns around the lake, and
continually ran into the same issue. You&#8217;d go into a store where nothing is
sorted by size, look through their stock and pick out a pair you like. They of
course wouldn&#8217;t fit, and then you&#8217;d be shown a dozen other pairs of pants that
share nothing in common with the ones you like. Pick out some nice looking black
pants with grey stripes, be shown some awful pastel pink ones as a substitute.
It seemed bizarre that I would see so many pretty fabrics at the markets, but
they seem to choose the most gaudy fabrics to make most of the clothes from. If
I&#8217;d been going home after Guatemala I probably would have just bought a bunch of
fabrics and figured out how to make clothes from them myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17057533565/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Panajachel Cathedral facade by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7713/17057533565_cdc7b25410_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Panajachel Cathedral facade" class="img-responsive"><em>Panajachel Cathedral facade</em></a></span></p>

<p>I visited Panajachel one afternoon, supposedly the most touristy place on the
lake, but because I hadn&#8217;t done any research and refuse to get taxi&#8217;s when I can
walk just fine I actually completely missed the touristy parts of the town and
wandered aimlessly through some rather dirty and grimy parts of the place. I
barely saw another gringo the whole time I was there, and I saw basically no
shops selling the usual tourist souvenir trash. Goes to show how different your
impression of a place can be depending on where you go there.</p>

<p>Another day I visited Santiago, one of the bigger towns on the lake and one that
I hadn&#8217;t met anyone else who had really been to. I happened to be there on a
market day and the place was crazy. Market stalls lining the roads all the way
from the dock right up into the centre of town, where a bunch of rides and food
stalls were set up in front of a church. This place surprised me in feeling way
more of a tourist trap than Panajachel, but maybe that was just because it was
market day.</p>

<p>The highlight of the week for me was going back to Santa Cruz to scuba dive in
the lake. I stayed at the hostel attached to the dive shop, La Iguana Perdida,
where I was put in a very nice dorm but not long after check-in I was told they
had made a mistake and needed the bed in that dorm for a big group that was
arriving. I said no problem, but when they showed me the second dorm it was
horribly crammed full of beds, with only top bunks left and the top bunks were
so close to the ceiling I couldn&#8217;t even sit up, and no lockers to secure away
valuables. I complained about the difference in quality between the two dorms
hoping to get a discount or something, but instead they upgraded me to a nice
little private double room. Winning!</p>

<p>The next morning I got up and had some breakfast at the restaurant then went out
diving with Oli, the instructor at ATI divers on Lake Atitlan. This was my first
time diving at altitude, and in fresh water, and in a collapsed volcanic crater
from 80,000 years ago. The lake is 1.5km above sea level, and most lakes at this
height would be damn cold, but geothermal activity in the crater actually heats
the lake to a much more comfortable temperature.</p>

<p>I got given a 2 piece farmer-john style wetsuit, 7mm thick plus a hood (meaning
14mm of neoprene on my torso), and the water temps were about 22-24ºC so I was
toasty warm for both the dives.</p>

<p>The dive boat was a tiny little fibreglass boat, small enough that when we did
out backward rolls entries we needed to go at the same time on opposite sides so
as not to flip the boat.</p>

<p>First dive site was in front of a hotel where the bottom part is now fully
submerged underwater. We descended down over a flight of stairs, then dropped
off the side down to the floor below. it was very surreal to be swimming around
past all these obviously man made structures while 15M underwater. There were
benches and steps and other landscaping features all around. At one point we
come to a place where there is a still working tap underwater. We turned it on
and you could hear the water flow and see particles on the floor move, and feel
the much colder water come flowing from the tap.</p>

<p>At points throughout the dives we turned over rocks and saw these strange little
insects with three forks of their body, which are apparently the baby versions
of the beautiful blue dragonflies you see everywhere. Crazy to think they start out
their life living under rocks at the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>We poked out heads up through a gap in the ceiling up to the surface of the
water and there was a little boy standing there who first asked if we could hear
him, then told us his mum had dropped her prescription glasses and his dad had
dropped a torch and asked if we could look for them. At first I wondered if he
was just messing with us, or if Oli had staged it or something, but we had a
quick scan around and I managed to quickly locate both of them and pass them
pass up to the kid. Search and recovery win!</p>

<p>We saw lots of purple crabs that would extend out their arms and open their
claws wide, trying to look bigger and scare us off, very cute. We also swam
through a bunch of dead reads that looked like rotting bamboo.</p>

<p>After a nice long surface interval, dive two went went out to a site called agua
caliente, where we went down above an underwater swimming pool about 3M under
water, then followed the natural slope of the lake down where there was lots of
really fine silt. Putting your hands in at various places you could find huge
variances in temperature, but with everywhere being warmer than the lake water.</p>

<p>We came up to some rocks that covered geothermal vents, where you could see the
water shimmering where the hot water mixed up with the colder water. Oli cracked
open an egg and sat it on the vent, the flow of which pulled bits of egg out and
sent them off separately in little chunks, definitely coagulating but not
cooking as thoroughly as I had imagined it might.</p>

<p>We came up a bit shallower to a steeper slope and set off some underwater
landslides of silt, which stirred up amazingly beautiful clouds of dust flowing
down the slope.</p>

<p>We stopped and lay on the bottom, trying not to blow too many bubbles and had a
bunch of fish come over and investigate. Fresh water fish all look the same to
me, but it was cool to see them none-the-less.</p>

<p>Apparently most of the fish in the lake are introduced; Some by the Mayan people
long ago for food, others by people trying to control a pest in the lake. Like
every time you hear a story like that, they had no predators so they thrived,
changing the environment and driving a bird that used to live in the lake to
extinction. Way to go humans.</p>

<p>Next we found a sauna, which I swam in through the hole where the heating barrel
would have once been. Inside looking up it was cool to see where all the air had
caught in a big bubble on the ceiling with some sort of a cord switch hanging
from the centre of the roof.</p>

<p>I went out the door and we headed in to the bottom floor of another hotel where
there was a small bar with a few beer bottles which we pretended to cheers and
have a drink. There was an air pocket above us so we could dump the water out of
the bottles and bring them down with some air in them, so they&#8217;d float as we
spun them upside-down. Turning them right way up the air gurgled out making some
very strange sounds.</p>

<p>Visibility was probably only about 5M, and there was a fair bit of muck and
algae in the water, but it was much warmer than I had been expecting. All up it
was a very unique diving experience and made a lot of firsts for me. First
altitude dive, first fresh water dive, first dive in a volcano, first search and
recovery dive, first underwater exploration of a building. I couldn&#8217;t see myself
wanting to stay and dive here daily like I can at ocean sites, but as a two-off
experience I loved it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16435125674/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Rachel weaving by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7600/16435125674_84460cf49e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Rachel weaving" class="img-responsive"><em>Rachel weaving</em></a></span></p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t see very much of Rachel this week since she was studying another week
of Spanish at a little school in San Juan where she was the only student, and
her afternoons were all tied up doing more weaving at another women&#8217;s
cooperative. I did drop by to visit her a few times and see her while she was
weaving.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16870048470/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Final Lake Atitlan sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8818/16870048470_53af905e9a_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Final Lake Atitlan sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Final Lake Atitlan sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the week she did come over and stay in San Marcos at La Paz for
two nights, so we got one last day to just hang out and wander around together.
We had a sad goodbye on my final day on the lake when we parted ways. After
travelling together for 6 weeks I was actually pretty scared about going back to
solo travel; losing the safe comfort of a friend that I&#8217;d gotten to know pretty
well and venturing back into the realm of meeting new people every day, usually
only for a few days at most, and all the repetitive small talk associated with
that. The perils of being an introvert while living a life like this.</p>

<p>So today marks two years since <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/2013/05/12/its-go-time/">I last set foot in Australia</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I can&#8217;t claim it&#8217;s been two years of real travelling, since I&#8217;ve been stopped in
the one place since January, but Roatan is a holiday island so my life still has
the same feel to it. People are always coming and going, which means meeting new
friends and having to say goodbye to them sooner than I&#8217;d like. I&#8217;m just no
longer the one having to lug my bag along to somewhere new all the time.</p>

<p>Looking back and thinking about all the beautiful places I&#8217;ve been in those two
years, the incredible things I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to do, and the amazing
people that I&#8217;ve gotten to meet, it&#8217;s fair enough to say that I have no regrets
about the sacrifices I had to make to make this all possible.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten to dive all along the Mesoameican Barrier Reef. I&#8217;ve climbed
volcanoes and seen them erupt with my own eyes. I&#8217;ve swam in the lakes of now
extinct volcano craters. I&#8217;ve made massive progress towards some day being
properly bi-lingual. I&#8217;ve been to my first Burning Man and spent 8 days in the
desert. I&#8217;ve explored some of the most raved about Cities in the USA. I&#8217;ve
wandered through the ruins of a bunch of ancient civilisations. I&#8217;ve dived in
the cenotes of the Yucatan. I&#8217;ve eaten the cheapest tacos from the dodgiest
looking street vendors you can imagine. I ate a cooked spider; on purpose. I&#8217;ve
been to the most extravagant Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico. I got to
see Cuba before the trade embargo lifts and rode around in beautiful cars nearly
twice my age. I&#8217;ve lived on a beautiful Caribbean island and gotten paid to
dive. I&#8217;ve made some life-long friends from all over the world who I look
forward to visiting some day (or yet again!). It&#8217;s been a wonderful year! Some
day I hope I&#8217;ll catch up on writing about it all :P</p>

<p>Nothing lasts forever, but the changes can always be seen in a positive light. I
can feel this trip beginning to draw to a close, so I&#8217;ll probably be seeing a
lot of my Australian friends again in the not too distant future. I&#8217;d love to
hold out just long enough to miss Melbourne&#8217;s winter, but I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;m
going be able to make it that far. I see challenges in my future readjusting to
life in Australia and the ridiculously high price of everything, finding a new
place to live, a new job to keep me busy, and trying to fit back into a
friendship circle that has evolved so much since I last saw them; but those are
all bridges I will cross as I come to them. For now I&#8217;m still relishing the last
few months of this amazing journey. Thanks for following along the ride!</p>

      More Schooling in Xela

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17031479206/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Xela by night by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7645/17031479206_264db61ac0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Xela by night" class="img-responsive"><em>Xela by night</em></a></span></p>

<p>The second time around in Xela I was actually pre-enrolled to head back to Celas
Maya and this time I&#8217;d opted to stay in a home stay family. The difference in
living standard between this one and all my previous ones was astounding. They
had a computer, a flat screen TV, a real washing machine, and even a marine fish
tank in the living room. These people were definitely a lot more well off than
previous families.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>After finding last time that 5 hours of classes was just too much for me to
take, I&#8217;d organised this time to only do four hours a day, giving me a bit of
extra time to go and do afternoon salsa lessons.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17055976172/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Little dog and his little kitty friend by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8709/17055976172_554d50ce16_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Little dog and his little kitty friend" class="img-responsive"><em>Little dog and his little kitty friend</em></a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I only made it through 2 hours of classes on my first day of
school before stomach problems and an aching head had me rushing to the
bathroom. I tried to stay for a bit longer but started feeling light headed and
decided I should probably go home and rest for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>I made it back to classes the next day, still not feeling fantastic, but well
enough to at least concentrate for the 4 hours. I decided I wasn&#8217;t well enough
to bother with salsa, so I hung out in a cafe and had a nice drink and worked on
uploading stuff for my blog and did some homework.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16869557998/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Rachel working a backstrap loom by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7712/16869557998_c9b5651c76_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rachel working a backstrap loom" class="img-responsive"><em>Rachel working a backstrap loom</em></a></span></p>

<p>By day three I was finally feeling more normal again. Classes went much better
and I organised a salsa lesson for late in the afternoon with Nestor. After
lunch, I went to visit Rachel who had enrolled in a backstrap weaving workshop
for her afternoons. It was interesting to see the looms in action, pulled tight
between a pole and the weavers back, with little rods to move back and forward
to alternate the weave between threads.</p>

<p>Dance lessons went well, teaching some foot patterns to side step and pull your
partner through to swap places, although I imagine that doesn&#8217;t make for very
interesting blog material.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16850011597/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Colourful graves stacked four high by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8707/16850011597_6b440f1661_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Colourful graves stacked four high" class="img-responsive"><em>Colourful graves stacked four high</em></a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon I made a visit to the huge cemetery near my house to explore. The
place was enormous and colourful, with many of the plots being stacked 4-5
tombs high. The place was also surprisingly busy with people wandering around.
One of the stranger things I saw there was an ice cream vendor selling ice cream
in the cemetery. Bizarre!</p>

<p>I found the family I stayed with far less friendly than previous homestays.
Conversations never got beyond pleasantries even though my Spanish was the best
it had ever been. Meals seemed to be served at very late and inconvenient hours.
The room I was in was much smaller than any other homestay too surprisingly,
with barely enough space to open the door with a bed, a card table and a little
plastic stool that needed to be moved out of the way to open or close the door;
not exactly a good study environment. I felt like this family was only taking
homestay students for the money (however little). In the end when I left, Marvin
Jr (the teenage son), was the only person around so I said goodbye and thank you
to him. I felt so little connection to the whole family that I really didn&#8217;t
give a shit if I said goodbye to them or not.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16869918290/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Delicious fondue dinner by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7634/16869918290_3f00b4e59e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Delicious fondue dinner" class="img-responsive"><em>Delicious fondue dinner</em></a></span></p>

<p>On my last night in Xela, Rachel, myself and another girl from Celas Maya went
out and had dinner at the Swiss place on top of the hill called panorama. The
place had great views of the city lights and had delicious spiced gluhwein. We
shared a big tasty cheese fondue, then followed it up with an amazing chocolate
fondue for desert.</p>

<p>This visit to Xela was far less eventful than last time, largely because of me
feeling unwell for half the week. Not so many stories or photos to show for it.</p>

<p>At the end of our week in Xela, Rachel, Sarah and I headed back to Antigua.
Sarah had to fly home from Guatemala City in a few days time, and I was happy to
go back and share the amazing ruins with them and explore a few more.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16436785383/in/set-72157651649474182" title="The Monastery of the Recollection by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7686/16436785383_b46e7e5de1_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="The Monastery of the Recollection" class="img-responsive"><em>The Monastery of the Recollection</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went to The Monastery of the Recollection convent again, and were lucky enough
to get another another tour from the same ground keeper. I was really please he
was there, it would not have been anywhere as good without being able to get
into the restricted parts again.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17056955075/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Me climbing up places where I probably shouldn't by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8717/17056955075_7a477bf284_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me climbing up places where I probably shouldn't" class="img-responsive"><em>Me climbing up places where I probably shouldn&#8217;t</em></a></span></p>

<p>I noticed a decent improvement in my understanding of his Spanish this time
around and the lighting was a little better this time around so I got to take
some more photos of the place.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16849641287/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Cathedral from central park by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8730/16849641287_e55747613f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Cathedral from central park" class="img-responsive"><em>Cathedral from central park</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went on the walking tour led by a guy named Alexander, telling us about
Antigua&#8217;s history and some of it&#8217;s ruins. It was from him that I found out how
the &#8220;public service&#8221; preservation of ruins is the reason so many of them are
just fenced off without any info or maintenance, and the lack of public funds to
change that.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17057053095/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Epic building facade from central park by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7639/17057053095_427a7da137_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Epic building facade from central park" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic building facade from central park</em></a></span></p>

<p>Many of Antigua&#8217;s old buildings are just their façades now, with either nothing
behind them, or completely new buildings built behind them. It was also from him
that I learned that the Cathedral off central park didn&#8217;t actually fall from the
earthquake, but rather from lack of maintenance. He told us that some work is
done now to stop it decaying any further, but they wont be restoring it.  We
learned how colonial style architecture in this area meant super thick walls to
withstand earthquakes, which also means generally dark building without windows.</p>

<p>The tour stopped in at a jade factory, where we were told how the Mayan empire
had collapsed because of their indulgent greed and decoration, and then at the
end we were pressured to try and get us to buy super expensive jade jewellery. I
think the irony was lost on them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16869314508/in/set-72157651649474182" title="A spiral of bells by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7593/16869314508_ea628150ce_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="A spiral of bells" class="img-responsive"><em>A spiral of bells</em></a></span></p>

<p>The tour finished up at a old ruin that is privately owned, San Jeronimo, which
now functions as a pretty great museum. We were told that because they don&#8217;t
have the UNESCO restrictions that the publicly maintained ones do, they&#8217;re able
to do things their own way and thus it&#8217;s in much better condition than pretty
much any of the other ones. Full of beautiful gardens and classy looking old
room, it&#8217;s apparently used for a lot of weddings.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17056229851/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Pimped chickenbus by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8738/17056229851_8f574614f7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pimped chickenbus" class="img-responsive"><em>Pimped chickenbus</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day Rachel and Sarah went to climb Volcan Pacaya; I had wanted to do a
tour in Antigua that I found online that visited a bunch of out of the ordinary
places including a coffin maker&#8217;s workshop and a chicken bus factory, but the
tour wasn&#8217;t available during the days I was around. The chicken bus factory was
the part that interested me most so I asked at the hostel and got some
directions and set out to find it myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16437018783/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Blue Bird by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7625/16437018783_bc4ebaf4e1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Blue Bird" class="img-responsive"><em>Blue Bird</em></a></span></p>

<p>As an aside for those in the dark, &#8220;chicken bus&#8221; is the moniker that pretty much
everyone in Central America uses for the old USA school buses (often Blue Birds)
that have been refitted and painted up, often with very bright and colourful
paint jobs and nearly always with lots of biblical passages as decals on the
windows.</p>

<p>I got on a chicken bus that took me to Ciudad Vieja (old city), a much more
authentically Guatemalan city next to Antigua. When I got off the bus, I had no
idea where to go, and just a scrap of paper with the name of the workshop
written on it. I asked in a little food shop and he gave me a general direction
to head in, and eventually I found the place I was looking for.</p>

<p>It turned out there was a whole cluster of places clumped together that all did
work on chicken buses so I visited a few of them. The first one had a lot of old
American school buses being painted and refitted, lots of people busy working.
There were a bit confused why a gringo would want to look around, but let me
walk through and see some shiny newly painted buses being worked on.</p>

<p>The place that I&#8217;d been given the name of by the hostel, Taller Horacios de
Camionetas, appeared closed when I arrived.  I knocked on the door anyway and a
guy who actually spoke a decent amount of English answered the door. He was
happy to let me come in for a look and told me a bunch about how they also make
new buses out of trucks, stripping them down and pretty much building entirely
new vehicles out of them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16870929509/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Chicken bus workshop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7664/16870929509_5295bd61d4_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chicken bus workshop" class="img-responsive"><em>Chicken bus workshop</em></a></span></p>

<p>Apparently buses take about 40-60 days to fit-out, and start from about 50,000
Quetzales ($6,500 USD) for a basic fit-out, but can cost a whole lot more if you
want lots of fancy lights and stuff. Depending on where the bus is going to be
used, they will actually shorten them so they&#8217;ll be able to get around tight
corners in that city, put in more powerful engines to deal with hills in the
area, change them over to have manual transmissions, or upgrade the engine
computers with ones from trucks in order to get more power from the engines. It
was fascinating to find out how unique each bus on the road must end up being.</p>

<p>The next morning we got up to say goodbye to Sarah at 4am before going back to
bed to sleep until a more sane time to start the day. After we&#8217;d had breakfast,
we got picked up by a shuttle to take us up into the hills above Antigua to an
eco-lodge and avocado farm called Earth Lodge where we were booked to stay for a
few days. It was a really nice location with a fantastic view looking out
towards Volcan de Agua and Volcan Fuego, surrounded by farmers fields and green
forests.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16869677300/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Smiling Rachel in a hammock by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8827/16869677300_f730d1aaac_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Smiling Rachel in a hammock" class="img-responsive"><em>Smiling Rachel in a hammock</em></a></span></p>

<p>We spent many hours in Earth Lodge&#8217;s numerous hammocks looking out that view of
the volcanoes, talking about everything and nothing, and got in a lot of reading
too.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16869700660/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Fuego erupting yet again by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7726/16869700660_dcbaae4340_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Fuego erupting yet again" class="img-responsive"><em>Fuego erupting yet again</em></a></span></p>

<p>During the period we were there Volcan Fuego seemed to be quite active, blowing
out plumes of smoke several times a day. It kind of made the effort we&#8217;d put in
to see Santiaguito erupt seem unnecessary, although I still think it was
worthwhile to actually hear the boom from up close.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17057304895/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Rachel in a farmers field by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8763/17057304895_3f1a46eb1b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Rachel in a farmers field" class="img-responsive"><em>Rachel in a farmers field</em></a></span></p>

<p>Most days we went on hikes further up into the hills to get some exercise,
passing a lot of farms that seemed to be growing flowers, and along trails
through the forest.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17057314095/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Earth Lodge sunrise by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7611/17057314095_88033a3df5_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Earth Lodge sunrise" class="img-responsive"><em>Earth Lodge sunrise</em></a></span></p>

<p>Being an avocado farm, the kitchen&#8217;s menu was well packed with meals that
included deliciously ripe avocado. They also made terrific fruit smoothies, so I
tried all kinds of strange combinations. I think my favourite combination was
strawberry and avocado.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17055820802/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Dry lightning storm by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8804/17055820802_4edc50e45c_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Dry lightning storm" class="img-responsive"><em>Dry lightning storm</em></a></span></p>

<p>One night, possibly the last one we were there, there was an epic lightning
storm. Lightning was streaking across the sky every few seconds lighting up the
clouds, and thunder was booming, but interestingly there was not a drop of rain
to go with it so we got to sit outside and enjoy the show. Nature is amazing!</p>

      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16436429083/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Xela by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7720/16436429083_602266b459_c.jpg" width="800" height="328" alt="Xela" class="img-responsive"><em>Xela</em></a></span></p>

<p>We arrived in Quetzaltenango, or Xela (pronounced sha-la) as pretty much every
refers to it, quite late on a Sunday afternoon. Travelling in my usual manner, I
showed up without having pre-organised my enrolment at the school, or a place to
stay.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Rachel and Sarah had both pre-enrolled and were staying in a home stay organised
through the school, Celas Maya, but being late on a Sunday I had my doubts about
whether I&#8217;d be able to enrol to start the next day, but it turned out that
wasn&#8217;t a problem at all so we were all set to start the next day on most
intensive class schedule I&#8217;ve done yet, 5 hours one-on-one a day, 5 days a week.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16839266107/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Celas Maya by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8798/16839266107_d62a8b5958_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Celas Maya" class="img-responsive"><em>Celas Maya</em></a></span></p>

<p>After my schooling was sorted I set out to find a place to stay. I ended up
getting my own private room at a newly started hostel not too far from school,
in an old colonial style house that had a big open courtyard in the middle.</p>

<p>I got an much earlier start the next day then planned, with a very strong
earthquake hitting nearby at 5:30am that rumbled long enough for me to realise
what it was, get out of bed and go stand in the door frame, and still have it
keep shaking for another 15-20 seconds while I stood there in just my boxer
shorts in the cold as everyone else in the hostel also appeared at their doors
around the courtyard in various states of undress. An exciting start to Xela!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17056570565/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Parque Central by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8820/17056570565_418f14b695_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Parque Central" class="img-responsive"><em>Parque Central</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was the middle of winter, and Xela is at a fair altitude, so mornings and
evenings were actually quite cold, and the middle of the day would heat up and
be almost hot, which meant I ended up dressing in layers and wearing zip off
pants to deal with the big swings in temperature.</p>

<p>I got assigned a teacher named Joel, a friendly younger guy who was into
photography, and would bring in photo books for us to look through and discuss
the buildings and places he&#8217;d taken photos of. It was actually pretty cool.</p>

<p>At the start of the week we discussed the stuff I wanted to cover and worked out
a basic plan for the tenses I wanted to work on and the areas he thought I
should include, and then each day the lessons would be quite varied. Some days
was entirely conversation, others I&#8217;d be working of a sheet of phrases and
changing their personas and tenses verbally on the fly, another day he even had
me listen to a song and try and work out the lyrics.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16436572473/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Pimped out chicken bus by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7698/16436572473_5cc513909a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pimped out chicken bus" class="img-responsive"><em>Pimped out chicken bus</em></a></span></p>

<p>Rachel, Sarah and myself got permission to take our teachers with us to the
market at San Francisco one day in place of classes so we could have a look
around and ask questions.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16436471023/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Bunny and duck by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7651/16436471023_b756586bd3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Bunny and duck" class="img-responsive"><em>Bunny and duck</em></a></span></p>

<p>We took a chicken bus there and then wandered around through the area where they sell
animals and livestock. There was all sort of animals, pigs and piglets, sheep,
cows, bunnies, cats, puppies, ducks, roosters and chickens and chicks. A lot of
them were super cute, but it was a bit sad to see how some of them are handled,
baskets full of chickens with a net tied over it to keep them in with there
heads poking out.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16849237107/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Mayan woven fabrics by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8824/16849237107_1f47d54d58_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Mayan woven fabrics" class="img-responsive"><em>Mayan woven fabrics</em></a></span></p>

<p>We looked around the clothing and fabric section and saw a load of beautiful
traditional Mayan fabrics in bright vibrant colours.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16434250184/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Rachel on the rooftop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7688/16434250184_fd76fedde5_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Rachel on the rooftop" class="img-responsive"><em>Rachel on the rooftop</em></a></span></p>

<p>We visited a church that let us go up onto  the roof to see the view. In the
Central American way, there was no real safety or barriers; just us walking
around on top of the big rounded rooftop.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17055240912/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Grains drying by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8825/17055240912_3ae7f377d3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Grains drying" class="img-responsive"><em>Grains drying</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went through the food and produce section and saw the open sacks of grains
and corn, often with big blankets covered in currently drying grains. Loads of
delicious looking fruit, and questionable looking cooked seafood just sitting out
in the sun.</p>

<p>I felt the more varied approach to learning at Celas Maya suited me way better
than any of the other schools I&#8217;d been to, and that my Spanish improved more here
than it did at any other point. It&#8217;s easily the best school I&#8217;ve been to yet. By
the end of the week though, I was feeling completely burnt out. Not so much by
the challenge, but being an introvert and having to spend 5 hours a day having
somewhat forced feeling conversation.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16426463073/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Fuentes Georginas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7699/16426463073_69b280234a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Fuentes Georginas" class="img-responsive"><em>Fuentes Georginas</em></a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon, we went on an excursion with the school to some natural hot
springs called Fuentes Georginas set high up in the hills. It was a beautiful
site with lush green plants all around it, and the heat of the pools helped add
to the mist that sort of hung over the place.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17045793041/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Fuentes Georginas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8826/17045793041_dc4753bbec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Fuentes Georginas" class="img-responsive"><em>Fuentes Georginas</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were three pools of water, each a little cooler than the one before it.
The hottest one I could barely cope with even just my knees in the water, the
middle one was still too hot to be comfortable, and the coolest one was much
better, but still too warm to stay in for long.</p>

<p>A lot of other afternoon I organised to take some private salsa lessons at a dance
studio with a great teacher named Nestor. While other lessons I&#8217;d taken had
focused entirely on actual dance steps, Nestor took the first lesson just to
work on actual stepping techniques, balance and weight shifting and gave me some
exercise drills to practice to try and develop smoother flow. It felt a lot more
productive than than just being told &#8220;loosen up.&#8221;</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16860332189/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Musik by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8820/16860332189_56c2c9cca4_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Musik" class="img-responsive"><em>Musik</em></a></span></p>

<p>We did cover actual dance steps too, but instead of just teaching a sequence
Nestor explained the ways to silently communicate to your partner what you&#8217;re
about to do. A gentle push to the hip here, raising a hand across their body,
all sorts of subtle hints like that.</p>

<p>On the weekend we did two more excursions through the school, although Rachel,
Sarah and I were the only ones who signed up so they were basically private tours.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16870562269/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Me above Laguna Chicabal crater by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8759/16870562269_1eebfee098_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me above Laguna Chicabal crater" class="img-responsive"><em>Me above Laguna Chicabal crater</em></a></span></p>

<p>One morning we met up at with our guide at school at 6am, and then got a
colectivo over to the town at the bottom of the old volcano that contains
Chicabal Laguna. We hiked up the long road through the forest to the rim of the
crater were we had a lovely view of the Laguna.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17030833636/in/set-72157651783002242" title="P1220487.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7678/17030833636_953bfb9ea9_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="Flowers by the laguna" class="img-responsive"><em>Flowers by the laguna</em></a></span></p>

<p>We then went down a long flight to stair to get down to the edge of the Laguna
and hiked around it before heading back up a different route and then back down
the long road to town to get a colectivo back to Xela.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17030887806/in/set-72157651783002242" title="In the hills near Xela somewhere by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7659/17030887806_3c982c628b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="In the hills near Xela somewhere" class="img-responsive"><em>In the hills near Xela somewhere</em></a></span></p>

<p>The other morning we were up at 4:15am to go and see Volcan Santiaguito, one of
the most active volcanoes in Guatemala, often erupting every half-hour or so. We
got a minibus to the start of the hike, then hiked for a few hours through
fields surrounded by thick green forests to the lookout to Santiaguito.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16849499117/in/set-72157651783002242" title="Me and Volcan Santiaguito erupting by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7684/16849499117_1f8f0b9233_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me and Volcan Santiaguito erupting" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and Volcan Santiaguito erupting</em></a></span></p>

<p>It erupted quite soon after we arrived with a thick plume of smoke, and then
after a slight delay there was a huge booming thunder as the sound of the
eruption reached us. It was really quite impressive to see and hear from so close.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16869375800/in/set-72157651783002242" title="It was rather cold and miserable up there by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7606/16869375800_2b651632e6_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="It was rather cold and miserable up there" class="img-responsive"><em>It was rather cold and miserable up there</em></a></span></p>

<p>We waited for nearly an hour in the hope we&#8217;d get to see it go off again, but
alas, it lay dormant after that first eruption, and we were all far too cold to
want to hang around waiting much longer.</p>

      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17002133052/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Cramped taxi boat by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7613/17002133052_d6dbf7d8b0_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Cramped taxi boat" class="img-responsive"><em>Cramped taxi boat</em></a></span></p>

<p>After leaving San Pedro, I made the long and arduous journey across the lake,
braving the calm freshwater sea couped up in a little boat for all of 10
minutes, finally arriving at the hippy shores of San Marco La Laguna.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Where San Pedro has a reputation as being the party village on the lake, San
Marcos is a much quieter, sleepy hippy town. The main part of the village is all
just narrow walking tracks, without taxi drivers harassing you every time you try and
walk down the street. It&#8217;s known for yoga, meditation and new age healing, and I
figured I would try some new things and see if my scepticism was well merited.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16817219649/in/set-72157651692973941" title="My dorm loft by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8731/16817219649_6530e6e000_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="My dorm loft" class="img-responsive"><em>My dorm loft</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ended up staying at a place called &#8220;La Paz&#8221;, hidden away in lots of green
gardens with little A-frame dorms where I scored the loft at the top largely to
myself for the duration I was there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17002050022/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Yoga space at my hostel, perfect for poi practice too by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8747/17002050022_e988e2cc5c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Yoga space at my hostel, perfect for poi practice too" class="img-responsive"><em>Yoga space at my hostel, perfect for poi practice too</em></a></span></p>

<p>It also had a great yoga space in the back garden which was mostly only used in
the mornings, so I repurposed it as a poi play space for a few hours most days
 and noticed some large improvements in my flow.</p>

<p>The restaurant at the hostel, and most restaurants in San Marcos, had a
vegetarian menu. I&#8217;m a big fan of meat, but after being deprived of any real
vegetables for 6 months, tasty vegetarian food was a welcome change. The place
made an awesome veggie burrito, and had some delicious French toast on the
breakfast menu.</p>

<p>I made it along to the hostel&#8217;s yoga classes most mornings, and was pleasantly
surprised with how good the yogi there, Charlie, was. I used to do a lot of
Yoga back in my university days and I used to love it, but every other time I&#8217;ve
done it since then the yogi&#8217;s have all fallen short and the classes have felt
dull and uninteresting, and usually they seem to have every pose requiring
ultra flexible hamstrings (which I don&#8217;t have), so I usually end up feeling like
I&#8217;m not stretching/working anything else.</p>

<p>Charlie&#8217;s classes however were much more similar to what I remembered from uni,
a good level of challenge and more varied poses, so at the end of it I would
feel like I&#8217;d used a lot more of my body. I found out she lived in India for a
number of years doing yoga before she&#8217;d had her first child, as had my yogi from
university, so perhaps that&#8217;s why their styles seemed more in tune with what I
like.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a mediation place in San Marcos called Las Piramides (The pyramids)
where all the accommodation cabins are pyramids, the garden is full of pyramids
frames, and they have a giant pyramid that they conduct meditation course in.
The place had a very new-age vibe to it with lots of references to meta-physical
this and that, and I figured if I&#8217;m going to try it, why not throw myself in the
deep end.</p>

<p>They run a four week meditation course where the students spend the entire
fourth week not speaking or making a sound.  I wasn&#8217;t about to sign up for that,
but it was apparently ok to go along just for the day, so I did. They were up to
week 3 of the current course, so perhaps it wasn&#8217;t the best place to start but I
gave it a go anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/sanmarcos/tumblr_lw1ymvkD9W1qh2i8s.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lake Atitlan" class="img-responsive" /><em>A stolen photo of the big meditation pyramid</em></span></p>

<p>The big pyramid temple has a strange entrance where you go down steps
underground, then back up steps into the temple through a hole in the floor.
Once everyone is inside the floor folds over the entrance like a cellar, so
you&#8217;re in a sealed up pyramid. There were some windows higher up letting in
light, but there&#8217;s no chance of leaving early.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/sanmarcos/one-of-the-meditation.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lake Atitlan" class="img-responsive" /><em>A stolen photo of pyramids within pyramids</em></span></p>

<p>In each corner of the pyramid, there were smaller pyramids, and in the centre of
the room there was a bigger one covered over by a piece of cloth. Once the
session started the cloth was removed, revealing a crystal ball mounted in the
top of the centre pyramid. New age mystical!</p>

<p>There were about 25 people in the room, sitting around the edges facing in, each
with a little padded mat and a little wooden slanted stool to sit on.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/sanmarcos/contact.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lake Atitlan" class="img-responsive" /><em>A stolen photo of inside the pyramid</em></span></p>

<p>The session started with 30 minutes of silent meditation, where we were told to
focus on our breathing. It was quite a challenge for someone who&#8217;s never tried
it before; after about 15 minutes one of my legs was completely numb. I tried to
manoeuvre it so the blood would flow again but it just wouldn&#8217;t wake up. After
20 minutes I didn&#8217;t care any more and made a bunch of noise switching my legs
around so the numbness would stop.</p>

<p>Next up we all lay on our backs, feet to the wall, heads towards the middle of
the room, and again focused on breathing. Breathing in 5 seconds, holding for 3,
then out for 5 seconds. Then 7-3-7, 9-3-9, 11-3-11 and finally 13-3-13. By about
the 9 second breaths, I was really struggling to stretch out my breaths any
longer.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977610346/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Lake Atitlan by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8728/16977610346_df88335f0b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lake Atitlan" class="img-responsive"><em>Lake Atitlan</em></a></span></p>

<p>Then there was some &#8220;ohm&#8221; chanting for about 5 minutes. It was kind of neat to
hear the room in chorus, with different people running out of breath at
different times and starting again, and how it affected the harmony. After a
while my face kind of felt a bit funny from all the vibrations.</p>

<p>Then there was some talking about finding your &#8220;life mission&#8221;, which was defined
as the thing that makes you happy. It seemed a bit simplistic to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977620066/in/set-72157651692973941" title="This cat decided to take the bed next to mine by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8746/16977620066_82a1798305_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="This cat decided to take the bed next to mine" class="img-responsive"><em>This cat decided to take the bed next to mine</em></a></span></p>

<p>Finally we did 7 more deep breaths, then rolled onto our sides, followed 7 more
breaths, then sitting up cross legged again while candles all around the room
got put out one by one.</p>

<p>During these last breaths I actually did feel like my mind was a lot clearer
than it had been at the start, a lot calmer with less jumping from thought to
thought. I can&#8217;t say I had any life changing revelations, but thinking about such
mechanical things are breathing, and &#8220;ohm&#8221;ing really did seem to clear my mind,
for a while at least.</p>

<p>I saw a flyer somewhere for a &#8220;meditation for dummies&#8221; class that was one while
I was around, so I called the number and signed myself up, to see what a more
beginner levels meditation class would be like.</p>

<p>It turned out I was the only person who signed up, so it was just a one-on-one
class with a woman named Edith. It started off with her telling me about all
different kinds of meditation: walking meditation, writing meditation, dancing
meditation, humming meditation, heart meditation&#8230; it all sounded a bit
overwhelming for a meditation noobie like myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17002593151/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Lake reclaiming houses by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7639/17002593151_2047f8fe07_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Lake reclaiming houses" class="img-responsive"><em>Lake reclaiming houses</em></a></span></p>

<p>We did some heart meditation, which was kind of like Tai Chi to music. We
started with our hands in front of our chests, slowly pushing our hands forward
and drawing them back in time with the music, apparently pushing out bad energy
and pulling in good energy. Then out to the sides and back, then pushing out
behind us and drawing back. To be completely honest, I felt stupid doing this
and didn&#8217;t feel like I got anything at all from it.</p>

<p>Next up was humming meditation. We hummed to &#8220;music&#8221; (a seemingly random
composition of drums, cymbals and other sounds) for about 40 minutes. This was
actually pretty intense on my throat; I was struggling to keep a hum going and
my lips were going numb. After humming, we did some more arm movements, pushing
out bad stuff like insecurity, jealousy and hatred, and bringing in good things
like happiness, confidence and gratitude. Strangely, this actually felt like it
calmed me down a lot. Or maybe I was just happy to not be humming any more&#8230;
who knows?</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16796198627/in/set-72157651692973941" title="I dont even know by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8755/16796198627_29cbbdd300_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="I dont even know" class="img-responsive"><em>I dont even know</em></a></span></p>

<p>Then we did some numerology stuff based on my birthday that apparently said some
positive things that were vague enough that they could apply to just about
anyone. Yep, I&#8217;m totally sceptic about that BS.</p>

<p>Next we did some writing meditation, which was basically writing out a bunch of
affirmations. I don&#8217;t doubt that affirmations can be helpful, but this didn&#8217;t
seem very sedative to me.</p>

<p>Finally we talked briefly about my poi and juggling, and it sounds like how I&#8217;ve
always said that they felt pretty much like meditation to me really isn&#8217;t far
off. I guess I&#8217;ve been meditating in my own way for a lot longer than I
realised, and in a way that&#8217;s a lot more fun. Go me!</p>

<p>At the end of my first day in San Marcos, Rachel - the Spanish school student I
met on my last night in San Pedro, send me a message asking if I wanted to try
and walk from San Pedro around the lake to San Marcos with her. I was keen so we
met up the next afternoon and gave it a shot, but after asking some people in
San Juan about safety on the road between there and San Marcos we were told
there were sometimes bandits along there so we ended up getting a tuk-tuk from
there instead, along what turned out to be a very hilly long road. I dunno if
there used to be a flatter path before the lake level came up so far, but it
didn&#8217;t seem like it would have been a very leisurely walk these days anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16383431423/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Rachel and I in front of Volcan San Pedro by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7636/16383431423_7e27567b05_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rachel and I in front of Volcan San Pedro" class="img-responsive"><em>Rachel and I in front of Volcan San Pedro</em></a></span></p>

<p>We ended up meeting up nearly every afternoon to go exploring somewhere new,
giving us lots of time to talk and get to know one another better. We explored
around San Marcos, checking out the park next to the best swimming spot in the
lake and up the hill to Mayan altars and some lovely views of the lake and the
volcanoes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17002659011/in/set-72157651692973941" title="Saint Peter (San Pedro) by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8700/17002659011_8884f673ab_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Saint Peter (San Pedro)" class="img-responsive"><em>Saint Peter (San Pedro)</em></a></span></p>

<p>We wandered around the streets of San Pedro, allowing me to experience it
without quite so much festival craziness going on, and found a nice cafe to sit
and have a drink in. We went over to Santa Cruz and walked up the hill along
narrow paths as far as the paths would take us, and then back down again.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17002143592/in/set-72157651692973941" title="P1030487.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7600/17002143592_d872739c89_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Sarah and Rachel" class="img-responsive"><em>Sarah and Rachel</em></a></span></p>

<p>Rachel&#8217;s sister Sarah arrived on the lake late in the week as she was coming
down to Guatemala for a few weeks too, so we all went to the swimming spot next
to San Marcos for the afternoon and had a nice swim in the lake, before heading
up the hill to show Sarah the views and altars.</p>

<p>At the end of the week Rachel was finished up at the Spanish school, and her and
Sarah were going to head over to Xela, and I felt like I&#8217;d tried enough
meditation for now and had been planning to go there anyway, so I tagged along
with them and we all booked a shuttle from the lake to Xela together.</p>

<p>My next destination was San Pedro La Laguna, a little town on the edge of Lake
Atitlan that I&#8217;d had recommendations about from numerous people I&#8217;d met in my
travels. I&#8217;d planned to go and study spanish there, and even had a
recommendation for a school from a girl I&#8217;d met in Antigua named Sue. Before I&#8217;d
even got my bag off the shuttle, I saw Sue walking by so she showed me the cheap
hotel she was staying in, but it was full so I went and got a bed somewhere
else.</p>

<p>I showed up at the school the next morning and was surprised that not only
Vecenti, the guy who runs it, could not only get me started with lessons that
day, but would be able to get someone in in half an hour and sort out a homestay
for me to stay in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16803061848/in/set-72157651239918317" title="My rooftop and room by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8704/16803061848_5879433708_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My rooftop and room" class="img-responsive"><em>My rooftop and room</em></a></span></p>

<p>My homestay family consisted of Gloria and Felix, the parents, their young son
Jose-Felix, their adult daughter and her husband. I had a room up on the roof
with a rooftop courtyard on one side and a semi-private bathroom on the other.
All meals except Sundays were provided, so it was an absolute bargain at just
$55 a week in addition to the $80 a week for one-on-one lessons, four hours per day.</p>

<p>The little boy, Jose-Felix, seemed to take a shine to me, always wanting to show
me the space ships he built from lego-like blocks and paper planes, and wanting
to show me how well he could read the stuff I was trying to read; so I was
definitely reading well below an 8 year old&#8217;s level at the time :P</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16989462492/in/set-72157651239918317" title="My neighbours guard duck by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8752/16989462492_980199e9aa_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My neighbours guard duck" class="img-responsive"><em>My neighbours guard duck</em></a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the family were friendly enough, although my limited spanish meant
all of the conversation was pretty superficial. Pretty much every meal came with
freshly made tortillas, Gloria would be slapping them out flat with her hands
and cooking them on the stove top before every meal. Meals were very, very carb
heavy, breakfast was often just bread rolls and a banana.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17001687332/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Lake Atitlan is rising by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7629/17001687332_1dbf762948_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lake Atitlan is rising" class="img-responsive"><em>Lake Atitlan is rising</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was apparently one of the rainy periods when I arrived, and so most afternoon
it would bucket down with rain turning the little narrow streets into nearly
knee deep rivers, so I&#8217;d hide out at a cafe and read while I waited for it to pass.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16370667803/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Lake Atitlan is rising by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8700/16370667803_8ba8708e5f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Lake Atitlan is rising" class="img-responsive"><em>Lake Atitlan is rising</em></a></span></p>

<p>The water level of the lake has apparently been steadily rising for the past 30
or so years, to the extent that a huge number of buildings are now partially
submerged underwater. It made for some rather captivating photos, but also added
some danger to swimming in certain areas as trees have died and been cut down
leaving only big stumps, which the water has then risen to cover. You&#8217;d be
swimming along and then, whack, you run right into a submerged stump. Luckily
there were some much deeper places to swim as well.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16803420260/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Treehouse at Casa Rosario by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7606/16803420260_1860127fb7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Treehouse at Casa Rosario" class="img-responsive"><em>Treehouse at Casa Rosario</em></a></span></p>

<p>Lessons at this school, Casa Rosario, were quite a bit different than at the
school I went to in Nicaragua. Things were a lot less structured, I could say
what areas I wanted to work on and we&#8217;d work on that. Initially I started off
really enjoying going over the stuff I didn&#8217;t even realise I already knew, but I
noticed a change in my mood when we got to stuff I started getting wrong where
I&#8217;d start to close up and become disinterested. Not very helpful behaviour when
I&#8217;m trying to learn something new.</p>

<p>I did learn quite a bit during the week of lessons, but I found the lack of
structure in the lesson content didn&#8217;t really work so well for me so I decided
not to stay for any more lessons after my first week.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17001720592/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Street festivities by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8697/17001720592_ae86fdc355_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Street festivities" class="img-responsive"><em>Street festivities</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next village over, San Juan, was having it&#8217;s yearly celebration for the
saint the village is named after, so my teacher and I had a very free form
lesson one day where we went over there and looked around, me asking questions
about the activities going on as a way to practice with more natural examples of
things to say and listen to.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16380822964/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Chicken float by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7647/16380822964_cab7db6769_c.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="Chicken float" class="img-responsive"><em>Chicken float</em></a></span></p>

<p>Each village on the lake has one of these kinds of festivals and it just so
happened that the one for San Pedro fell during the entire week I was there, so
the place was super busy, getting busier each day leading up to the peak on the
weekend. Stages were set up, the streets were lined with little stalls selling
all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>One of the traditions all through Guatemala seems to be setting off &#8220;bombas&#8221; to
celebrate. A bomba is basically a rocket firecracker. They drop an explosive in
a little steel contraption, kind of like a mortar launcher, and light the fuse,
then after a few seconds a huge bang sends the thing up in the air about 200
meters where the second explosion goes off even louder than the first. No pretty
streams of light or coloured flashes, just pure noise, and because it&#8217;s up so
high for the second bang the sound travels far and it&#8217;s loud all over town.
These things were being set off constantly, night and day; it was like being in
a warzone and it drove me crazy. One night at about 3:30am they let off 20-30 of
them all in the span of about 5 minutes. SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GO TO SLEEP!</p>

<p>I asked my family about them but all I could get from them was that it was
tradition. No real significance. They apparently cost $15-20 for the small ones,
so families pool money together to buy them. Seems like a great waste of money
in a place where people are so poor. Worse still, watching them actually be set
off near one of the nightly concerts I noticed that aside from us gringos,
nobody even seems to even react to them. These people need to be introduced to
fireworks, so at least there&#8217;s something to see.</p>

<p>One one of the days there was a big parade through the town with all sorts of
floats. Giant chickens, giant ants, crazy costumes, and the strangest one, a
little girl sitting between to huge boxes made of chip packets and juice boxes.
No idea what it was supposed to be, maybe a big advertisement for the products?</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16815413398/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Volcan San Pedro from San Marcos by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8722/16815413398_d3221c2498_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Volcan San Pedro from San Marcos" class="img-responsive"><em>Volcan San Pedro from San Marcos</em></a></span></p>

<p>Early one morning I set off to climb Volcan San Pedro. It was a long and fairly
steep climb, 1.5 kilometres of vertical ascent in total with the top being 3050
metres above sea level (the lake itself is already 1.5 KM above sea level).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977329346/in/set-72157651239918317" title="We put the snake back on the path for the next person by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8718/16977329346_2dea1652ce_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="We put the snake back on the path for the next person" class="img-responsive"><em>We put the snake back on the path for the next person</em></a></span></p>

<p>Part way up the guide got a shock from a big long snake on the path, before
realising it was dead. He picked it up with a stick and gave us a better look at
it, then carefully put it back to freak out the next group. Nice gesture!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16817137849/in/set-72157651239918317" title="So very green! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8699/16817137849_36eed2f312_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So very green!" class="img-responsive"><em>So very green!</em></a></span></p>

<p>We were pretty slow going and it got pretty muddy and slippery as we neared the
top. The forest at the top was really beautiful and green, and smelt like a
forest should.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16817140679/in/set-72157651239918317" title="The view from the top - Cloudy by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8705/16817140679_424421f5c7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The view from the top - Cloudy" class="img-responsive"><em>The view from the top - Cloudy</em></a></span></p>

<p>When we reached the top, the view was a uniform white wall of cloud, so we sat
and rested and waited, hoping it might clear.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977371566/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Me at the top of Volcan San Pedro by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7614/16977371566_9e3b18f402_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me at the top of Volcan San Pedro" class="img-responsive"><em>Me at the top of Volcan San Pedro</em></a></span></p>

<p>It took nearly an hour, but eventually we got 5 minutes where the clouds broke
up enough that we could see the lake and it&#8217;s surrounding villages and actually
get an idea how high up we were.</p>

<p>On my last day at my homestay I was in a seriously bad mood. I&#8217;d been kept up
all night by bombas going off, and then I&#8217;d put in all my clothes at the laundry
and been given back half of someone else&#8217;s stuff and a bunch of my stuff was
missing, so I was hiding out in my room trying to nap. I got a knock on the door
from Gloria, telling me there&#8217;d been some kind of mix up at the school so there
was another student coming to stay that night, so I would have to share my room
with someone from their extended family for the night. With the anti-social
grumpy mood I was in, and me leaving the next day, I really didn&#8217;t feel like
having to meet anyone new. I actually kind of resented this new person for
coming into &#8220;my space&#8221; and I hadn&#8217;t even met them.</p>

<p>I continued my nap, and later when I awoke I found the new student, Rachel,
outside in the hammock of the courtyard. We talked for a bit, I found out she
was a school teacher from California, down in Guatemala for 5-6 weeks to try and
learn Spanish. She seemed really lovely and friendly and asked if I wanted to go
get dinner with her. I nearly said no, just because of bad mood I was in, but I
decided to go along anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16817190599/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Wheels of death by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8739/16817190599_bd9d79245a_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Wheels of death" class="img-responsive"><em>Wheels of death</em></a></span></p>

<p>We had a nice dinner and some drinks, talked a bunch and got along really well.
After dinner we wandered around the festivities in the street, looking at the
sketchy looking rides and amusements set up in one part of the town, and later
watched some of the live music and dancing at one of the stages. I was very glad
I&#8217;d ignored my bad mood, because I ended up having a really nice evening. Even
the massive crowds of people everywhere didn&#8217;t bother me for a chance.</p>

<p>We were both planning on going to another city called Xela in the next few
weeks, so we traded numbers so we could stay in touch and maybe meet up and hang
out again there some time. I was a bit sad that our time at the school hadn&#8217;t
overlapped, but was hopeful that we would catch up again in a few weeks. Little
did I know at that time that we would end up hanging out and travelling together
for nearly the next two months :)</p>

<p>Next stop for me was Antigua Guatemala, the original capital of Guatemala until
they got sick of all the earthquakes knocking it over every few decades. It&#8217;s a
very beautiful city, littered with ruins of majestic old ruins of buildings that the
government doesn&#8217;t have enough funds to do preservation works to, so most of them
are fenced off without so much as a plaque to say what it was.</p>

<p>My first day in Antigua, I went with an Aussie couple I met at the hostel to
explore some of the markets in the city. We went to the &#8220;real&#8221; market and a few
of the tourist ones and the differences were striking. The real markets were
busy, noisy places, each shop seems to specialise in selling only one type of
things, largely stuff I wouldn&#8217;t need but it was interesting to see and made for
some nice photos. The tourist markets on the other hand were big places with
pretty much no one in them but the shop owners, filled with hundreds of shops
all selling the same kitsch crap.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16337486063/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Egg McFuckin' Muffin &amp; Advil please by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7589/16337486063_cd6d1e023e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Egg McFuckin' Muffin &amp; Advil please" class="img-responsive"><em>Egg McFuckin&#8217; Muffin &amp; Advil please</em></a></span></p>

<p>We stopped for lunch at a place that my Aussie friends had heard was good and
they had a pretty amusing menu featuring an egg mcfuckin&#8217; muffin and free Advil!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16770116540/in/set-72157651649474182" title="How the Egg McFuckin' Muffin comes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8719/16770116540_8df599cc96_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="How the Egg McFuckin' Muffin comes" class="img-responsive"><em>How the Egg McFuckin&#8217; Muffin comes</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ordered myself the egg mcfuckin and thought it seemed like a good deal coming
with a free cocktail. I was pretty surprised when it came out and the muffin,
fries and fruit came out on skewers in the cocktail, like cocktail stirrers!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16956446822/in/set-72157651649474182" title="It was a short muddy walk to the top by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7623/16956446822_812f3862a5_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="It was a short muddy walk to the top" class="img-responsive"><em>It was a short muddy walk to the top</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next day I booked myself in for a trip up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacaya">Volcan Pacaya</a>, one of
Guatemala more active volcanoes that last seriously erupted in 2010, blowing ash
so high that it even rained down on the modern day capital Guatemala City.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16770337980/in/set-72157651649474182" title="These guys followed us trying to get us to ride their horses up.

Doubly anoying for me as they set off my horse allergy</em></a></span></p>

<p>The walk up wasn&#8217;t too challenging, there were a few steep parts with very fine
(thankfully damp) gravel-ish soil, but for the most part it was an easy walk up
a hill. There were some guys with horses that insisted on following us and
trying to coerce us into paying to ride a horse up instead, shouting &#8220;taxi&#8221; at
us over and over. Annoying on a bunch of levels, making the nature we were
surrounded by feel as obnoxious as a city street, covering the trail in horse
shit, and triggering my allergy to horses pretty severely.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16771637859/in/set-72157651649474182" title="It was like the surface of some other planet by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7629/16771637859_344c0e4323_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="It was like the surface of some other planet" class="img-responsive"><em>It was like the surface of some other planet</em></a></span></p>

<p>When we got to the top, it was like looking at the surface of another planet. An
huge hill of jagged black volcanic rocks, steam vents letting out steam all
over the place.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16363276783/in/set-72157651649474182" title="The lava store/tourist trap by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8721/16363276783_cab6e6e3df_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The lava store/tourist trap" class="img-responsive"><em>The lava store/tourist trap</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was a little shop up there selling souvenirs, working under the novel
pretence of being a shop on a volcano.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16982473711/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Marshmallow taco by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7626/16982473711_9532de2492_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Marshmallow taco" class="img-responsive"><em>Marshmallow taco</em></a></span></p>

<p>However, the highlight was being able to roast marshmallows over invisible
volcanic heat vents. They were some of the tastiest roasted marshmallows I&#8217;ve
ever had; we even toasted a few tortillas and made a marshmallow taco!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16363293653/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Turns out dogs love marshmallows by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7636/16363293653_ef199282ed_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Turns out dogs love marshmallows" class="img-responsive"><em>Turns out dogs love marshmallows</em></a></span></p>

<p>We actually had a dog follow us up the hill the whole way, and found there were
a whole bunch of them at the vents where people roast marshmallows, who had
apparently developed a taste for marshmallows.</p>

<p>While in Antigua I also took advantage of some of the free salsa lessons on
offer around the city. I was absolutely terrible to start off, and didn&#8217;t
improve very quickly, but I could feel a lot of similarities in the learning
with the way I have to learn new poi moves; repetition of the basics over and
over until I no longer have to think &#8220;ok, what&#8217;s next&#8221; and can free up my mind
to concentrate on the more complicated aspects. I do wish rhythm came a bit more
naturally to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16363383863/in/set-72157651649474182" title="This part of the wall fell a long way from the rest of it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8697/16363383863_8ef0495537_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="This part of the wall fell a long way from the rest of it" class="img-responsive"><em>This part of the wall fell a long way from the rest of it</em></a></span></p>

<p>I explored a few of the more maintained ruins around the city, but the most
impressive one for me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Recolección_Architectural_Complex">Convento La Recolección</a>, an old cathedral and
monastery/convent. I&#8217;d barely entered the site and a grounds keeper approached me
and started showing me around as a bit of a tour guide, all in Spanish which was
good practice but may mean I have some mistranslations.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16797269099/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Ruined courtyard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7644/16797269099_f52a4e9fa2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ruined courtyard" class="img-responsive"><em>Ruined courtyard</em></a></span></p>

<p>The level of the soil is apparently now about 3 metres higher than it was, so
big parts are now buried. He showed me around a few of the courtyards with tons
of rooms leading off them which I think the inhabitants used to live in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16982080292/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Danger by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7622/16982080292_5d9ae698a4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Danger" class="img-responsive"><em>Danger</em></a></span></p>

<p>We then went to a little room with a big locked door with &#8220;Danger&#8221; written on it
in Spanish, that he proceeded to unlock and lead me in. Inside was a chapel, one
of the less destroyed parts of the site. I went down a little hole in the ground
down a ladder and into the catacombs where it was pitch black. There was a dark
tunnel leading off that I was told was an ancient secret passage between here
and one of the churches over in the middle of the city. Amazing! I wish I&#8217;d had
a better flashlight than my iPhone.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16361062454/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Secret garden by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7591/16361062454_84e547d8cd_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Secret garden" class="img-responsive"><em>Secret garden</em></a></span></p>

<p>The chapel was beautiful, a beautiful example of nature reclaiming man made
structures. Green moss growing over most of the surfaces, a hole in the roof
letting light stream in on top of a little garden of ferns. I really wish I&#8217;d
had a tripod to take a series of shots of varied exposures to have a go at some
proper HDR shots, but I made do with what I had and got some nice shots anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16361094544/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Epic ruinage of the monastery of the recollection by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7605/16361094544_1a0d73517c_c.jpg" width="800" height="173" alt="Epic ruinage of the monastery of the recollection" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic ruinage of the monastery of the recollection</em></a></span></p>

<p>The last part he showed me was the cathedral itself, which must have had 30-40
meter high ceilings and walls several meters thick, now largely in huge chunks
on the floor. The earthquakes must have been incredible to knock this place down
so thoroughly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16797299179/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Convent of the order of mercy fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8709/16797299179_ce3ac8ec8d_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Convent of the order of mercy fountain" class="img-responsive"><em>Convent of the order of mercy fountain</em></a></span></p>

<p>Other highlights where the massive fountain inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Merced_Church">Iglesia La Merced</a>,
27 metres across and set inside a huge courtyard.</p>

<p>And the cathedral next to central park. From the outside I didn&#8217;t even realise
it was a ruin, but inside all of the domes of the ceilings are gone and a few
other bits have collapsed, making some stunning natural skylights. I heard that
this one wasn&#8217;t actually a victim of the earthquakes, but rather collapsed
because of a lack of maintenance.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15852033030/in/set-72157649787007102" title="Waterfall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8635/15852033030_5086636e7e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterfall near Lago Yejoa" class="img-responsive"><em>Waterfall near Lago Yejoa</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a cram packed week up in the USA, I felt like I really needed a bit of a
rest, so once I got back down to Honduras I headed directly down to Lago Yejoa,
the home of the D&amp;D Brewery.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The brewery is attached to a hostel set on a little forested block of land, both
of which are run by Bobby, the late-20s American owner. He tells me he runs
the brewery as a bit of fun, and to provide some jobs for the locals. Apparently
the area wasn&#8217;t really on the tourist circuit at all back before he started up
here, and now lots of people are coming to the area specifically to visit the
brewery and then are told about the local natural attractions around to visit.</p>

<p>Bobby makes some pretty tasty beers, from memory there were maybe 5-6 different
ones on tap but I&#8217;ve neglected to keep any notes about what they were. They&#8217;re
made in a sort of large scale home brew manner, using malt extracts and hops. I
asked Bobby if he&#8217;s thought about doing it with actual grains (the all-grain
homebrewer in my past believes it&#8217;s the only way to make exception beers), and
he told me he&#8217;d originally bought a pallet of grain with the intention of doing
it all that way, but the humidity in the area makes it near impossible to store
the stuff without it spoiling and growing mould, which seems like a pretty fair
reason for doing it the way he does.</p>

<p>The place has a nice little restaurant that makes pretty good burritos and
baliadas, but their most impressive menu option is the blueberry pancakes which
have a very generous portion of fresh blueberries cooked into them. I think I
ate them for breakfast nearly every morning I was there. They&#8217;re so good I&#8217;d
probably recommend going their for the pancakes even if you don&#8217;t like beer!</p>

<p>One night I got talking with an Irish guy named Johnny who is one of the most
interesting people I&#8217;ve met on the road so far. He&#8217;s an Irish bloke who makes
his living as a travel blogger, travelling 9 months out of every year and living
in Thailand the other 3.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15852046620/in/set-72157649787007102" title="Johnny and the lake by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7516/15852046620_49658900ab_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Johnny and the lake" class="img-responsive"><em>Johnny and the lake</em></a></span></p>

<p>The guy is like one of those self made success stories you&#8217;d read about in a
magazine. He started off with a travel blog, and then worked out how to make
very decent money online through SEO marketing. He had visited 114 countries
when I met him (now 141 with the slow rate I update my blog), and plans to visit
every country in the world in the next few years. I&#8217;ll chuck in a plug for <a href="http://onestep4ward.com">his
website</a> in case you want to see for yourself.</p>

<p>It was really interesting to talk to someone who&#8217;s been on the road so long, a
whole lot more insightful than the average backpacker about the difficulties and
challenges of truly living life on the road, as opposed to just living overseas.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16038626042/in/set-72157649787007102" title="D&amp;D Brewery by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7492/16038626042_a74543b628_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="D&amp;D Brewery" class="img-responsive"><em>D&amp;D Brewery</em></a></span></p>

<p>Johnny and myself did a hike up to a nearby lookout the next morning, and we
were half way up when my flip-flops decided to tear through the toe strap,
leaving me to do the rest of the way up and the way back barefoot. The view from
the top was pretty nice and my feet held up surprisingly well, although I did
get some nasty ant bites and found it very hard coming down hill through all the
mud.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853267539/in/set-72157649787007102" title="Me and the view by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7491/15853267539_275da5e0a0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me and the view" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and the view</em></a></span></p>

<p>After nearly a week at D&amp;D I was feeling re-energised and so I got the chicken
bus to Copan via San Pedro Sula, during which I had the closest thing to a bad
experience I had in Honduras.  At one point a man got on, stood up at the front
of the bus and asked me in English where I was from. After a little bit of small
talk he switched to Spanish and started yelling something at the bus, then
started digging around in his bag for something. I thought for sure we were
being hijacked and he was about to pull out a gun, but then he actually pulled
out a bible and continued to yell at the bus for 15 minutes, before taking of
his shirt and showing that he was covered in religious (prison?) tattoos. A huge
sense of relief washed over me when I realised he was a preacher and not a
hijacker.</p>

<p>Once I&#8217;d arrived in Copan and found somewhere to stay, me and a few guys from
the hostel went to check out (probably) the only authentic German brewery in
Honduras. We&#8217;d gone there at 3pm in the afternoon to have a beer or two and get
something to eat, but ended up staying until about 11pm and drinking many beers.</p>

<p>The brewery is run by an older German guy named Thomas, who&#8217;s imported all the
shiny brewery equipment from Germany himself, and has big temperature controlled
fridges for fermenting his 120 litre batches. He imports all the German malts
himself and mostly brews adhering to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a> (German beer
purity law), although he tells me he does make a hefeweizen with cacao beans in
it which sounds like it would be delicious! Getting shown around the back room
and all the brewery bling had me reminiscing about my years as an all-grain
homebrewer throughout university.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16453437188/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Thomas who runs the only German brewery in Honduras by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8624/16453437188_e7d37d3d3c_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Thomas who runs the only German brewery in Honduras" class="img-responsive"><em>Thomas who runs the only German brewery in Honduras</em></a></span></p>

<p>The two beers on tap while I was there were a hefeweizen and a red lager. I really
enjoyed the hefe, but everyone else seemed to prefer the lager. One thing is
certain, Thomas definitely makes some of the best beer in all of Honduras!</p>

<p>The next day I headed to a place called Macaw Mountain, a private bird reserve
aiming at repopulating the Macaws in the local area. They also have a bunch of
other exotic Central American birds such as toucans, and parrots, all of which
have been donated by pet owners who no longer wanted them, or confiscated from
bird smugglers.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16018395964/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Me and a bunch of macaws by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8584/16018395964_1f82870c5e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me and a bunch of macaws" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and a bunch of macaws</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a big interactive area where you could get a photo taken with a bunch of
the Macaws; they&#8217;d perch on you and then you&#8217;d twist your wrist a little and the
birds would spread their wings for the photo!</p>

<p>They were actually keeping a whole lot of macaws at Copan Ruins to try and get
them used to the area, and then later opened their cages releasing them into the
wild, in an effort to repopulate the Macaws the feature so heavily in the
carvings there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16639283661/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Toe biting toucan.

What a little bastard" class="img-responsive"><em>Toe biting toucan. What a little bastard</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was also a very naughty toucan, for some reason missing his tail feathers,
that hopped around on the ground trying to peck at toes. I was initially running
away from him every time he hopped up to me, then I decided maybe I was being
silly and let him get me&#8230; it was quite a painful peck. Cheeky little bastard!</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t visit Copan without visiting the ruins that the place is named after,
so I headed out there the next day and grouped up with a big family (half
Americans, half Hondurans) and got a guide to show us around the site.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16639405781/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Copan main steps by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7284/16639405781_489ed94d71_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Copan main steps" class="img-responsive"><em>Copan main steps</em></a></span></p>

<p>The ruins were vertically very tall, but it really wasn&#8217;t that big of a site.
The &#8220;amazing detail&#8221; that people had been telling me about actually seemed kind
of plain, especially compared to other ruins like Angkor Wat (although now
having seen other Mayan ruins, Copan really is quite detailed compared to other
Mayan sites).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16018478584/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Copan by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8657/16018478584_eb2dd7b3bf_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Copan" class="img-responsive"><em>Copan</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s lots of work that&#8217;s been done reconstructing many of the building of
Copan. Our guide pointed our a few odd shaped hills and told us that that is how
they all were when the site was found, with tree roots tearing the structures
apart, dirt filling in the gaps and eventually just looking like a pile of
rubble. It&#8217;s actually quite incredible they&#8217;re able to figure out how to put
them back together at all.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16454733849/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Standing over Copan by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7286/16454733849_19916c22f2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Standing over Copan" class="img-responsive"><em>Standing over Copan</em></a></span></p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16433620557/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Partially restored building by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8629/16433620557_331ea701fd_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Partially restored building" class="img-responsive"><em>Partially restored building</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also found out that the biggest structures actually used the previous
buildings on the same site inside them as foundations. Modern tunnels have being
dug into the buildings to get a look at some of the enclosed previous temples.
Not exposed to the weather, there is a lot more preserved details. There were
lots of great carved statues of macaw&#8217;s faces statues in the tunnels, but it is
a shame it&#8217;s so narrow in there and they&#8217;ve fenced off a lot of it now so you
have glass between you and statues, because previous visitors couldn&#8217;t keep
their damn hands to themselves.</p>

<p>After a long day looking at ruins, I headed back to town and went back to
Thomas&#8217; brewery for a few last beers in Honduras, before I started heading into
Guatemala the next day.</p>

<p>Way back in January at <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/2014/07/01/poi-love-camp/">Poi Love Camp</a> I&#8217;d asked
Jonathan Alvarez what he thought the best flow festival was during them summer
in the USA, and he told me he thought FireDrums was number one, so I put it in
my calendar and mostly forgot about it. Much later I realised it was only a few
weeks away, and decided to impulse buy a ticket, sort out some flights and get
my self along to see it for myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853206187" title="Best row on the plane! by Lucas Parry, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7472/15853206187_c65e1f1d44_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Best row on the plane!" class="img-responsive"><em>Best row on the plane!</em></a></span></p>

<p>I flew from San Pedro Sula (aka. Murderville) to San Francisco, with a brief
stopover in Houston, but a delayed flight meant that I was arriving at 11pm
instead of 9pm like I had intended, so it was very late by the time I left the
airport, which meant I got the royal introduction from San Francisco wackos,
from the crazy guy on BART who was laughing and ranting, telling everyone that
he wasn&#8217;t dead, and that he&#8217;d killed Elvis, to the super friendly homeless guy
on the bus who was very insistent that I had to visit Pier 39 while I&#8217;m in town
to see the real San Francisco.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16013228826/in/set-72157647472845853" title="Camille, my couchsufing host by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8576/16013228826_6e22fd4350_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Camille, my couchsufing host" class="img-responsive"><em>Camille, my couchsufing host</em></a></span></p>

<p>I was staying with some people I&#8217;d gotten in touch with through couchsurfing, a
very hospitable girl named Camille and her lovely house mate Rose. They were
awesome! They even had a little dinner party one night; I couldn&#8217;t have asked for better hosts.</p>

<p>I had a day in San Francisco to sort out things I needed for FireDrums (sleeping
bag, camp mat, food. I was lucky enough to get offered a lift and a spot in
someone&#8217;s tent which saved me a whole lot of hassle), but I started off the day
by exploring some of the mission street, one of the oldest and longest streets
in the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853224077/in/set-72157647472845853" title="Awesome alley of murals by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8593/15853224077_0a37dc5248_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Awesome alley of murals" class="img-responsive"><em>Awesome alley of murals</em></a></span></p>

<p>I found some cool little alleyways full of murals, Clarion Alley in particular.</p>

<p>During the day I ended up walking nearly the entire length of Mission street
right down to the ferry building (I switched over to Market at some point when
Mission got too seedy for me, I think it was about the time I saw a deaf woman
gesturing blowjobs at passing cars, then at me), with a quick detour to the
camping shop to pick up the stuff I needed and a quick stop in at Chez Maman, a
restaurant that pretty much everyone I know from Melbourne who&#8217;s been to San
Francisco seems to rave about.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853233307/in/set-72157647472845853" title="Super fancy burger at Chez Maman by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7478/15853233307_04a5160076_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Super fancy burger at Chez Maman" class="img-responsive"><em>Super fancy burger at Chez Maman</em></a></span></p>

<p>Chez Maman was a tiny little place, mostly just counter seating along the grill.
I got a basic burger with goats cheese, and it was pretty good, but that and a
beer came out to $25 with taxes and the tip so it was more than I would have
liked to spend just on lunch. Maybe I&#8217;d feel better about it if I still had an
income.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851877370/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Holy fuck these trees are big by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7506/15851877370_574018e185_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Holy fuck these trees are big" class="img-responsive"><em>Holy fuck these trees are big</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next morning my ride to FireDrums, a friendly bloke named Peter, showed up
in his truck and we headed a few hours north to Navarro; the beautiful FireDrums
site fully of enormous redwood trees. Peter was kind enough to offer me not
just a ride, but also some space to sleep in his tent which made flying in for
the event a whole lot easier than it could have been. Thanks again mate!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16039011385/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Completed teserect by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7557/16039011385_4feca349af_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Completed teserect" class="img-responsive"><em>Completed teserect</em></a></span></p>

<p>On arrival we quickly put up Peter&#8217;s tent, then went off to work our first
volunteer shifts. As part of keeping costs down, everyone attending FireDrums is
expected to help out by doing a few volunteer shifts. I volunteered for one of
the setup shifts, which resulted in me working on putting together the stand for
the Teserect, a magical mirror filled box that belongs to Prometheatrics.
Prometheatrics happens to be the burning man camp I was lined up to camp with,
so as a bonus I got to meet a few people from the camp, TeaFaerie, Sean and
Spin, all of whom are lovely.</p>

<p>Wandering around later that afternoon I ran into Tim and Lou, two more spinners
I&#8217;d briefly met back home in Oz, who were touring around the USA hitting all the
bit flow festivals. Nice to see some familiar faces and hear some accents from
home.</p>

<p>I also bumped into Jonathan who gave me a super excited welcome as though I was
flow-famous or something. That guy is so damn friendly!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853254257/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Opening ceremony by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7519/15853254257_39bfd6bd6a_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Opening ceremony" class="img-responsive"><em>Opening ceremony</em></a></span></p>

<p>The event opened with an opening ceremony around the fire circle, led by Sky (?)
and Ben Drexler, yet another person who made a huge number of youtube tutorials
I&#8217;ve watched.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16013259326/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Timmy teaching tapedeck torrids by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7493/16013259326_296308a805_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Timmy teaching tapedeck torrids" class="img-responsive"><em>Timmy teaching tapedeck torrids</em></a></span></p>

<p>Each day of FireDrums was cram packed with workshops for all different kinds of
things, from poi to staffs, hoop to juggling, footwork to flexibility. I took
some great classes about all different kinds of poi throws and tosses which I
feel add a bit of a club juggling flair to spinning poi; classes on different
advanced stalls, Tim&#8217;s classes on iso-pendulums and tape-desk toroids, and a
bunch more. With some many workshops each day, you really had to accept you
couldn&#8217;t go to all of the ones you wanted to, and if you went to one in every
timeslot you were thoroughly burnt out with information overload for the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851750940/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Burn night one by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8602/15851750940_7343ce9717_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Burn night one" class="img-responsive"><em>Burn night one</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;d been wanting to purchase my first set of fire poi for a while, and so had
been looking around at all the market stalls and had narrowed it down to just a
few different types of wicks. After the fire circle started up the first night,
I managed to find some people with the kind I was looking at who were kind
enough to let me have a go with them lit up, so I could get a better idea of how
they differed.</p>

<p>I ended up splashing out for some twista style wicks, glow-in-the-dark soft pom
grips, and fancy new Technora fire resistant rope leashes instead of the
traditional chains, so that my fire poi and my LED poi feel a bit more similar.
I got in a good number of burns each night and have been extremely happy with
the new poi.</p>

<p>One evening their was a showcase of performers getting up on the stage of the
amphitheatre to show off their skills. There was some fantastic partner acts and
one of the most amazing hoopers I&#8217;ve ever seen. An epic display of talent on show.</p>

<p>My other volunteer shift was a fire safety shift, relieving a pretty girl named
Leora of her post. Being a fire safety pretty much involves sitting at the edge
of the fire circle with a blanket of fireproof material called Duvetyne,
watching people spin, keeping an out out for any clothing that catches alight
and letting the wearer know (and help them put it out if needed. My shift was
pretty trouble free, mostly just putting out peoples props who were done
spinning, although I did need to put the back of one dudes pants out that had
caught on fire.</p>

<p>I should stop and say the fire circle was pretty crazy. Never before have I seen
so many people spinning fire in one place, and so much talent. Even with all the
safeties around, it almost felt like there was too much going on for everyone to
have someone keeping an eye on them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16037109191/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Burn night two by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7540/16037109191_9b823e1b2b_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Burn night two" class="img-responsive"><em>Burn night two</em></a></span></p>

<p>I find the contrast between Australian and USA approaches to safety really
interesting. In the USA white gas is the fuel of choice, while in Australia it&#8217;s
frowned upon because it&#8217;s quite a bit more dangerous and people prefer fuels
with kerosene-like properties. Kerosene burns cooler, and it needs a wick to
burn, which means that fuel spraying off or being spilt are less dangerous (but
still not good). You can drop a lit match into a bucket of kerosene-like fuel
and it will go out. Do the same with a bucket of white gas and you have a huge
problem. Kerosene-like fuels do have the downsides that they don&#8217;t burn as
cleanly or as brightly.</p>

<p>Now the interesting part is (perhaps because of these choices in fuel), I&#8217;ve
gotten the impression that people from the USA are far more conscientious about
having a dedicated fire safety person around when people spin, with proper
equipment around to put out fires. Maybe it&#8217;s just me being unobservant, but I
feel like I&#8217;ve spun fire, or seen people spinning fire back home in oz a load of
times but I&#8217;d never been or seen a fire safety for anyone. I don&#8217;t recall seeing
Duvetyne in real life before going to the USA; at most I&#8217;ve heard of people
using wet towels. It&#8217;s funny how each country seems to have focused on
optimizing one aspect of safety, but ignores another aspect.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851788020/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Burn night two by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8631/15851788020_837b4b3c83_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Burn night two" class="img-responsive"><em>Burn night two</em></a></span></p>

<p>Anyway, after sitting in the cold, being a fire safety for 2 hours, I went out
and had another few burns with my new poi to warm up again. On my last burn of
the night, I was offered some titanium powder, a substance you can apply to your
props that makes them throw off little firefly like sparkles, especially when
they stop abruptly, like in a spiral wrap. Wanting to see sparkles, I did a
spiral wrap (perhaps too early in the burn with too much excess white gas, or
perhaps the heat from the burning titanium?), and
when the spiral unwrapped the top of my hand was on fire. I patted it out and
kept spinning until the fuel on the poi burned out, after which I noticed it was
actually quite a painful burn so I headed to first aid who gave me some
antibiotic cream and told me to expect blisters.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419500053/in/set-72157647464916314" title="My first spin related burn by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8616/15419500053_e7dd8ed50a_c.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="My first spin related burn" class="img-responsive"><em>My first spin related burn</em></a></span></p>

<p>The pain was pretty nasty, so I ended up taking some painkillers and some
sleeping tablets and went to bed just so I didn&#8217;t have to put up with it any
longer. Anyway, it&#8217;s a lesson I wont soon forget in being careless with new
fuels that I&#8217;m not familiar with; both the titanium powder and the white gas.</p>

<p>The next day we got up and packed down the tent, and Peter mentioned he&#8217;d
organized to give some chick a lift back with us to San Francisco, who turned
out to be Leora from fire safety the night before.</p>

<p>Peter was very keen to go to some hot springs on the way back called Harbin
that were &#8220;clothing optional.&#8221; I think I saw one maybe person wearing pants.
You&#8217;d be the strange one if you weren&#8217;t naked.</p>

<p>Leora seemed equally hesitant as me to strip off, but I figured YOLO and we all
stripped off and went and bathed in the springs. For the most part, me and Leora
stuck together, so it was really good to have a
&#8220;not-completely-comfortable-with-this&#8221; buddy there with me to share the
experience with. Peter on the other hand seemed completely in his element. To be
honest it was actually a lot less awkward/uncomfortable than I had imagined it
might be. When everyone is naked it doesn&#8217;t seem like such a big deal at all.</p>

<p>There was a super hot &#8220;meditation&#8221; pool, a hot &#8220;quiet&#8221; pool&#8221; a warm pool, an icy
cold pool and a big swimming pool. We went into the hot pool for a little bit,
then the super hot pool for all of about 30 seconds before it was too hot, then
the icy pool, then the warm pool again, then the swimming pool&#8230; and then back and
forth a bit more. It was a rather enjoyable way to relax for a few hours.</p>

<p>Coming back into San Francisco the bay was crazy foggy; a stark contrast from
when we left in the other direction and it was clear blue skies. You couldn&#8217;t
even see the top of the Golden Gate bridge as we drove over it.</p>

<p>We dropped Leora off at the airport then headed back to Peter&#8217;s place where he&#8217;d
been kind enough to offer me his couch for a few nights.</p>

<p>I spent the few days before my flight exploring various places around San
Francisco, some touristy, some of very little interest to most people.</p>

<p>I fan-stalked past Github HQ. I made a visit to one of the regular spin jams

<p>After making a one night stay in San Pedro Sula, home of the worlds worst murder
rate, I headed over to the coast and got a ferry to Utila; one of the
Bay Islands of Honduras.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I had gone there with the idea in my head that I wanted to stop and do dive
master training, a cheap way to get in a few month of daily diving. I had
flights booked to go up to California for a fire spinning festival in 2 weeks
time, so this visit was mostly just about shopping around and seeing how the
various schools compared.</p>

<p>As soon as I got off the ferry and mentioned I was considering doing my DMT, I
had a shop offer me 2 free fun dives with them, even after I made it clear I was
shopping around. The offer remained, so I had my first shop locked in!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853183127/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Utila from the water by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7520/15853183127_77791cc3a5_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Utila from the water" class="img-responsive"><em>Utila from the water</em></a></span></p>

<p>The diving around Utila was really good. The reefs were healthy looking, some of
the walls were fantastic, the there was a good amount of aquatic life around.
Big crabs, lobsters, cowfish, drumfish (especially the juveniles), bearded
toadfish, free swimming green moray eels&#8230; plenty of cool stuff every dive.</p>

<p>During the week on Utila I ended up diving with about 5 or 6 different shops,
and got a much better idea about the things that are important to me in picking
where I want to do more training. Some had tiny boats and some had fairly big
boats. Some went to the better diving on the north side pretty much daily,
others only went 1-2 times a week. Some were so relaxed about safety that they
weren&#8217;t even doing a head count, let alone boat roll calls, when diving north
side (2 hours from the inhabited part of the island, pretty poor IMO) while
others were clearly following good procedures.</p>

<p>One night I was in a bar (ok, nearly every night&#8230; often it feels like more
people are on Utila for the parties than the diving) and I got talking with some
guys who turned out to have a set of fire poi and some kerosene, so we all
headed to the beach to spin fire. It was my first time spinning with real flames
in about a year, but it was also the first time I know of that I&#8217;ve been
videoed, so I can actually show more than just still images for a change.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com//www.youtube.com/embed/LMa0Ox5I3N4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>Looking at the video afterward, I can see a lot of places where I was falling
into pretty dull repetitive sequences, but I still think there&#8217;s some good stuff
in there. I feel like I&#8217;m a shit load better today, but then again I mostly spin
LED poi so I probably cant do everything I can do now if I was using fire poi.</p>

<p>Later that night I went along to a beach party and a couple of other spinners
where doing their thing. I asked if I could have a go and the small crowd seemed
to really like it. I had a few people come up to me randomly in the bar
afterwards and ask about it, if I was a part of the performers. Lots of
encouragement and support, pretty damn good for someone who hates being in the
spotlight, I think it helped a lot with my fears and anxieties.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16013168646/in/set-72157649802065395" title="A baleada - the staple food of Honduras by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8601/16013168646_89e64ea82e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="A baleada - the staple food of Honduras" class="img-responsive"><em>A baleada - the staple food of Honduras</em></a></span></p>

<p>I pretty much lived on baleadas the whole time I was on Honduras. A baleada is
basically like a big cheesy quesadilla with different fillings, like chicken and
avocado, which I would then apply liberal amounts of hot sauce to. A place on
the island called Mamma Rosa Baleada had them for just a few bucks and they were
so big they hung over the edge of the plate, so I ate there every day, sometimes
more than once.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853182307/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Inside a baleada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8634/15853182307_d98fc373a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Inside a baleada" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside a baleada</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were a few things I really didn&#8217;t like about Utila. The first of those is
the sand flies. The bastards are everywhere and insect repellent doesn&#8217;t work for
them. One day just before (or maybe just after) rain, they were super intense.
Horrible itchy bites all up my legs :( Some people claim that baby oil on your
legs will stop them because they cant land or drown in it or something, but I
tried it and it didn&#8217;t seem to do anything. Maybe I needed to shave my legs to
make it work. Way worse than mosquitos.</p>

<p>The second pet peeve was the motorbikes and taxis that are ruining Utila. For a
tiny little 1 road strip, there&#8217;s a horrible amount of traffic constantly
zipping past, just barely missing people. They nearly always seemed to be full
of lazy locals, which makes a nice change from seeing them full of lazy
tourists.</p>

<p>In the end my pick of the dive shops for Utila would be Utila Dive Centre, they
ran a very professional environment with quality gear, they have a number of
boats of different sizes and I just got a good vibe from them. Of course I wasn&#8217;t
ready to commit to anything without having also checked out Utila&#8217;s neighbouring
island, Roatan.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851500988/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Roatan looking stormy by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7567/15851500988_46d02430fb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Roatan looking stormy" class="img-responsive"><em>Roatan looking stormy</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a week of changing dive shops every day, and not really feeling like I was
making much of a connection with many of the people I was diving with, I decided
in Roatan I was more interested in just checking out the various dive sites and
deciding if the diving was better there or on Utila, so when I arrived I picked
a shop and I stuck with them the whole week I stayed.</p>

<p>I stayed the first two nights on the island with two girls I met on the ferry
over, Nev and Tandea, since the price of a room for 3 was the same as dorms, and
the three of us went with Reef Gliders, the dive shop that offered a discount on
the accommodation where were were staying.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851502248/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Sunny when we got to Roatan by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7473/15851502248_1d7cab6108_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Sunny when we got to Roatan" class="img-responsive"><em>Sunny when we got to Roatan</em></a></span></p>

<p>Most of the week I was diving with the same divemaster, a guy named Mickey from
South Africa who&#8217;d come to the island a decade or so ago, just for a week, but
never left. Mickey is a guy who never dives without his camera, and I later
found out that one of the Caribbean reef life photo books that you find in
nearly every dive shop in along the Caribbean Coast is actually entirely by him.
You could not get a better DM to dive with for fish ID!</p>

<p>The diving was good at Utila, but it was amazing on Roatan. I can tell you for
certain, all those backpackers making claims about how there&#8217;s no point going to
Roatan over Utila and that it&#8217;s just for rich tourists, are just regurgitating
what others have told them because a) the diving is both a lot better and a lot
lazier (longest boat ride was 10-15 minutes from the dock) and b) the prices are
actually very similar to Utila. I think over the course of 10 dives it was less
than $50 difference, although restaurants were admittedly more expensive (street
food was cheap though!).</p>

<p>My favourite dive was at a site called Texas. It&#8217;s a site off the tip of the
island which almost always has a lot of current, although there was apparently
abnormally little the day I got to dive it so apparently there was less marine
life activity than usual but it was still amazing. Since there&#8217;s current you do
the dive as a drift dive, where you get in at one place and let the current take
you while the boat follows on the surface; it makes for extremely lazy diving.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419306323/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Barracuda by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7545/15419306323_dde483b5e9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Barracuda" class="img-responsive"><em>Barracuda</em></a></span></p>

<p>The site gets it&#8217;s name, because like the state, everything is bigger at Texas.
The reef you&#8217;re drifting above is massive, trailing off for hundreds of meters
in every direction, one direction sloping down until you couldn&#8217;t see anything
but blue. We dropped down to about 25 metres, probably 2-3 metres above the
reef, and floated along at a nice lazy pace for the duration of the dive,
eventually popping up on the surface what must have been at least a kilometre
from where we started.</p>

<p>During the dive we saw loads of big stuff. Probably a dozen or more really big
groupers, some turtles who cruised along with us for a while, a number of squid,
and easily the biggest lionfish I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>We also made a stop to check out &#8220;Jesus&#8221;, one of the many massive barrel sponges
down there. I&#8217;m told that some of them are thousands of years old, and Jesus is
one of the biggest ones. It&#8217;s opening would probably be about the size of your
average household washing machine, the thing was enormous! Sadly, we found that
a big chunk from the top of the sponge had very freshly been sliced by a
fisherman&#8217;s line. It wont kill it, but it&#8217;s a shame that something thousands of
years old can get damaged like that.</p>

<p>Another notably unique dive was a site called the bear&#8217;s den, when you go down a
dark tunnel into a rock (with a flashlight) which opens up into a cave with a
&#8220;skylight&#8221;, big enough to have 5 divers in there at once. It really was the sort
of cave you&#8217;d imagine a bear would live in, except it was some 25-30M underwater.</p>

<p>Loads of the dives were walls of coral, dropping down well below the depths you
can go down to on scuba, many with big canyons and swim-throughs zig-zagging
back and forth, but one of the coolest ones was at Haller deep. There we dropped
down to 41M where the wall went from a slope to a near vertical drop, and you
can see nothing but dark blue below you. We saw a pretty sweet turtle down there
with a shark sucker cleaning him.</p>

<p>We came up from down there slowly, through a number of long tight swimthroughs,
following the reef back towards the island where we saw pipefish, a pipehorse,
scorpion fish and a few green eels.eventually we passed through a shallow part
of the reef with a max depth of 3M before dropping back down to about 5M to
another bit of reef where we had a bunch of snorkellers above us and we saw
flounder, yellow line arrow crabs and razor fish. Total bottom time was 63
minutes, pretty amazing to have a dive where we had stuff to look at at both 41M
and 3M, and be down there so long.</p>

<p>By the end of my time on the island, I was pretty sure I would want to do my DMT on
Roatan over Utila, but actually less certain that I wanted to sign up for it
right away. I decided to put it off until at least after Burning Man, and until
I&#8217;d seen the reefs in Belize and Cozumel, just in case they were even better
again.</p>

<p>After I was done hiding out in Esteli over easter, trying to avoid the masses of
locals who apparently usually head to the coasts and cause a ruckus, I booked a
flight from Managua to Big Corn Island. This was the most last minute flight
I&#8217;ve booked thus far, less than 24 hours before the time of the flight, although
it made no difference at all to the cost. Hooray for fixed price flights!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I played the &#8220;put everything heavy on my person and as much as possible in my
carry-on&#8221; game to make sure I beat the 15kg luggage limit. It turned out that at
the airport they actually get you to hop on the scale with your carry-on
(passenger weight actually matters on such small planes), but I felt pretty safe
that me and my bags would probably still weight less than some of the obese
people I&#8217;d seen on buses.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15797453391/in/set-72157646984886813" title="The Planes to Big Corn by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7486/15797453391_31ff4f83ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The Planes to Big Corn" class="img-responsive"><em>The Planes to Big Corn</em></a></span></p>

<p>Knowing it was a small plane, I was very surprised by the number of people at
the airport, the waiting area was packed! It turns out they run multiple planes
along the route for each scheduled flight. That day it was two little single
propeller 12 seaters and one bigger plane. I got put in one of the 12 seaters,
and scored a seat directly behind the pilot.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614166357/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Right behind the pilot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7545/15614166357_1a4ae860d3_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Right behind the pilot" class="img-responsive"><em>Right behind the pilot</em></a></span></p>

<p>We flew quite low for most of the flight giving nice views of the country,
maxing out at 9500 feet (I could read the dials from where I was sitting).
Looking down from a tiny little plane like that makes flying feel wondrous, like
it really should.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15797481511/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Murkey brown beaches. yuk by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8414/15797481511_d59e9dec9e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Murkey brown beaches. yuk" class="img-responsive"><em>Murkey brown beaches. yuk</em></a></span></p>

<p>As we were flying over the last of the mainland, the terrain below us was very
swampy and wet, and the Caribbean sea close to shore was all brown and murky
looking for about half a kilometre before it turned into a nice blue like on the
post cards.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15800937592/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Coming in to land by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5615/15800937592_8b60c1568c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Coming in to land" class="img-responsive"><em>Coming in to land</em></a></span></p>

<p>On landing I was impressed and surprised by just how quickly the plane came to a
halt. I wonder how long the tyres on one of these little planes last, braking
like that?</p>

<p>Collecting luggage was a disorganised mess. Three planes full of people crammed
into a 4M x 4M room, with guys bringing the bags in a few at a time, and
checking your baggage tags matched. Mine thankfully came up quite early on, some
people had to wait for a fourth plane to come with their luggage.</p>

<p>From the Big Corn Island airport, I shared a cab to the dock where I caught a
ferry to the place I actually wanted to be, Little Corn Island. The seas were a
lot rougher than they had looked from the air, but a seasickness pill kept me
feeling fine for the duration of the journey.</p>

<p>The evening I arrived on Little Corn the power was out. The island normally only
has power for a few hours a day, but something had gone wrong with the island&#8217;s
generator, so the only places with power were the fancier hotels that had their
own generators. This made for a fun time getting my bearings, wandering out in
the dark, trying to follow path ways and find somewhere to have dinner.
Eventually I gave up and went to the restaurant attached to one of the fancy
hotels.</p>

<p>I stayed the first few nights in a place near the pier called Three Brothers,
but that side of the island doesn&#8217;t get much wind so the place I was in was
stinking hot, and inland enough that you don&#8217;t get the whole island vibe. After
a few nights there I moved over to a little cabin on the beach at Elsa&#8217;s place
over the other side of the island for pretty much the same price, where I could
see the water from my door, and stepped out my door right onto the sand.
Constant cool sea breezes, a much nicer location!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15775878106/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Conch shell art by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7498/15775878106_65d6c5b1d1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Conch shell art at Elsa's place" class="img-responsive"><em>Conch shell art at Elsa&#8217;s place</em></a></span></p>

<p>That said, the staff at Elsa&#8217;s place were some of the least friendly people I&#8217;ve
ever met, and there was some stuff about the place that was just plain weird.</p>

<p>There were two towels in my room for me to use (a nice unexpected bonus), but
there was no toilet paper in the shared toilets for pretty much the whole time I
was there. I ended up stashing my own roll in my room, but I have to wonder what
they&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>Every time I went to the reception to do anything I seemed to get dirty looks
from the hoard of staff sitting around, and they all continue sitting around and
scream to some woman from out the back to come and serve. I would see them being
nice among themselves, laughing and smiling, but as soon as a tourist was
involved they&#8217;d instantly swap those smiles for scowls and behave like you had
insulted their mothers or something. Even when I went to pay for my stay there,
the grumpy woman barely did more than grunt at me. Too lazy to get up off her
fat arse when I went to the counter, and then she acted very put out when she
had to stand up to collect $105 I owed; a lot of money in Nicaragua. I struggle
to believe it&#8217;s just a cultural thing, the family running this place really just
seem to hate the very people they rely on for income.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614640840/in/set-72157646984886813" title="The path to my beach hotel by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5609/15614640840_916536c448_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="The path to my beach hotel" class="img-responsive"><em>The path to my beach hotel</em></a></span></p>

<p>I asked if I could use the laundry sink I&#8217;d seen near my room. No. I asked if
they had a laundry service. No. I asked if they could tell me somewhere I could
go to get my laundry done. No. Ok, screw you then. I&#8217;m going to take stupidly
long showers wearing my dirty clothes to wash them in there then. Backpacking
life.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time spinning poi while I was on the island. Nearly every day
I&#8217;d find somewhere nice and shady and put on an album and just play around
practicing different things until the album stopped. Some days I&#8217;d do a second
album back to back. I was trying to focus on doing things slowly and with more
control, and I found the Amelie soundtrack as nearly perfect for that, with
Opiuo&#8217;s Meraki thrown in for something a bit more upbeat now and then.
Definitely saw some good improvement during the time I was there.</p>

<p>The diving on Little Corn, the whole reason I was there, was fantastic. Lots and
lots of big marine life. I think I saw at least one nurse shark on every single
dive, often more. One dive we had a small one follow us around the entire dive
like a cute little puppy dog. Most dives I&#8217;d also spot loads of southern
stingrays, lobsters, juvenile angel fish, baby drumfish, spotted trunkfish,
trumpet fish, Atlantic spadefish, blue tangs, scorpionfish, groupers and creole
wrasse. The reef seemed to very quite healthy, with some of the more colourful
coral I&#8217;d ever seen. Lots of purples tubes and greens fans for a change.</p>

<p>After being buddied up with noobie photographers far too many times I&#8217;ve
developed my own set of rules for buddy&#8217;s on recreational dives, which goes
against everything PADI teaches, but PADIs buddy rules were made before every
other fuckwit with 4 dives under their belt bought a GoPro so I don&#8217;t think
they&#8217;re a good fit for random pairings.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you have a problem, the nearest person is your buddy.</li>
  <li>Likewise, Always help someone who needs it.</li>
  <li>Never go to far from the nearest diver that you don&#8217;t think you could make it
back again without another breath of air.</li>
  <li>Conversely, give me some space and don&#8217;t dive right on top of me. Anyone
should be able to hold their breath for 20-30 seconds, or maybe they should
reconsider getting the in the water.</li>
  <li>Be responsible for yourself.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the (unspoken) rules I stick to when buddied up with someone I&#8217;ve never
met before.  Sorry if that makes me a dick, but I don&#8217;t know what sort of a
diver you are so I&#8217;m expecting the worst.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to follow you around while you scare sea-life sticking your GoPro
in their frightened faces. If something goes wrong and I need air, I&#8217;m not
wasting time trying to figuring out who and where you are; I&#8217;m going to get air
wherever it&#8217;s available, the nearest person. Then, once the high-stress incident
is over, I can find my &#8220;buddy&#8221;, or more likely the DM for advice on what step to
take next; most likely to abort the dive.</p>

<p>Forget PADI/SSI&#8217;s buddy system when you&#8217;re diving with holiday divers you&#8217;ve never
even met before, it&#8217;s just not safe or realistic. Rant over</p>

<p>One new thing I&#8217;d never seen before now is the spearing of lionfish to protect
the reefs in the Carribean. Lionfish are actually a species from Asia that have
accidentally been introduced here, that have very few real predators while they
eat the juvenile offspring of the fish native to here. And thus, pretty much
every dive guide will carry a spear with them and spear any lionfish they see,
often then feeding them to a passing nurse shark.</p>

<p>This has had the interesting effect on nurse shark behavior that they will now
follow groups of divers around during dives, hoping to get an easy meal.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how others seem giddy to be killing something and
feeding it to sharks or the lobsters. I actually kind of feel sorry for them. We
are pretty much all &#8220;introduced&#8221; humans. We&#8217;ve done bad things to the
environment, and wiped out entire species. Imagine if we were targeted for
elimination as pests/danger to the place we lived.</p>

<p>I got the chance to go out on just one night dive, but I got to see almost
everything you could hope to see on a night dive. A mushroom scorpion fish, 7+
southern stingrays, a friendly little remora who snuck up on the sand next to us
while we had lights out to check the bioluminescence and then stayed there
watching when we turned them our lights back on, a toadfish. I spotted a
Caribbean reef octopus amongst some seaweed with nowhere to hide, it was awesome
to see him changing colours, through yellow, blue and green trying hopelessly to
hide. We saw 2-3 green turtles and a giant big loggerhead as well, some peacock
flounders hiding on the sand, a reef squid , some nudibranch, lots of lobsters
and hundreds of shrimp. You could spot the shrimp from quite a distance as their
eyes reflect the torchlight back as little pink dots on the coral and rocks.
Some were quite big, and really fast moving. As is often the case, the night
dive was easily my favourite.</p>

<p>(Sorry about how text heavy this is. Feel free to gift me an underwater camera
and I promise my diving posts will be way more interesting!)</p>

<p>One afternoon I walked almost the entire way around the island, along the beach
past all the fancy hotels that I could never afford to stay at, to lots of
beautiful stretches with nothing built along them, just natural as they should
be and lined with coconut forrest.  Eventually I got to a point where it was
just pretty much vertical cliffs with waves crashing against them, so I went up
a part that wasnt completely straight up, and ventured along random goat tracks
in the forest until I found the village.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15775872256/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Scorched earth by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7574/15775872256_8cf92c9c85_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Scorched earth" class="img-responsive"><em>Scorched earth</em></a></span></p>

<p>I was half expecting to stumble across some secret hideout for Columbian drug
smugglers, but all I found was a big chunk of forest that had recently had a big
fire. No idea how they would have managed to put it out, they may have just had
to let it burn out.</p>

<p>Guessing how long I would want to be on Little Corn Island up front (by booking
my flight as a return) meant there were a few days after I was done diving where I
didn&#8217;t have very much to do; not always a bad thing. I got in lots of reading,
resting and practicing poi.  But I was definitely looking forward to getting off
the island towards the end. Not having internet was making it very hard to work
out what I would be doing once I was back on the mainland.</p>

<h1 id="visa-run">Visa Run</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15613751839/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Middle of the runway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5614/15613751839_0882408d78_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Middle of the runway" class="img-responsive"><em>Middle of the runway</em></a></span></p>

<p>After Little Corn, I got the ferry back to Big corn and spent the night there
before my flight the next morning. I walked from where I was staying to the
airport terminal via a shortcut directly across the runway tarmac!</p>

<p>This flight I was put on a bigger place, which flew via Blue Fields. This was
much less exciting than flying in the small plane.</p>

<p>Still not having committed to what I wanted to do when I arrived, I decided
mid-flight that when I landed I was going to head straight for the Costa Rican
border to do a visa run. Having spent nearly 3 months in Nicaragua, My CA-4 visa
that was supposed to cover Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was
nearly expired and I hadn&#8217;t even made it to two of them yet.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15179633054/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Chicken bus by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5613/15179633054_a95bd56d5a_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Chicken bus" class="img-responsive"><em>Chicken bus</em></a></span></p>

<p>As is always the case, the taxi from the airport to the bus station cost more
than the buses from there, half way across the country to the border and into
Costa Rica. I&#8217;d heard bad things about this border crossing taking hours on
occasion, but again I managed to get through in under 30 minutes. Maybe I&#8217;m
lucky, or maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m doing things on the local buses instead of with
a bus full of other foreigners clogging things up. I dunno.</p>

<p>A had to wait out 72 hours in Liberia and I didn&#8217;t really do much beyond
reading, working through my Spanish workbook and sorting photos. Coming back
from Nicaragua, I was sort of blown away by just how expensive Costa Rica
seemed. Last time coming from the UK it had seemed cheap!</p>

<p>Crossing back into Nicaragua didn&#8217;t go quite as smoothly. I found out that Costa
Rica had started charging an departure tax since the last time I did this
crossing, and I found out the only place you could pay it was, not at the border
where you&#8217;d like, but half a kilometre back into Costa Rica at a shitty little
office. It&#8217;s a $7 tax, plus an unavoidable $2 &#8220;service charge&#8221; and it took them
half an hour to do whatever it is they&#8217;re doing. They do accept
their own currency, but the rate they offer is terrible.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why countries do stupid stuff like this. It just means
you leave their country on a sour note. It&#8217;s going to be the most recent thing
in your memory associated with the country. Not the nice time you had at the
beach, but how they made you walk a kilometre in the hot sun with heavy bags,
and then made you stand around and wait to pay a stupid tax. I&#8217;d rather have bribed a
border guard $10 and not have to mess around with this nonsense, but I&#8217;m not
that ballsy.</p>

<h1 id="leon">Leon</h1>

<p>My original plan was to try and make it as close to the Honduran border as I
could in a day, so I could try and do the run up to San Pedro Sula the following
day, but as luck would have it a bad childhood tooth filling that regularly
seems to cause me troubles started to feel like it was coming loose, and having
heard that Nicaragua was America&#8217;s equivalent to Thailand for dental work, I
figured I would stop and get it looked at.</p>

<p>I made it to Leon by about 5pm, found a hostel and then got them to recommend a
dentist, and by 6:30 I was in the dentist chair getting two old fillings that
she identified as bad drilled out. Amazing how quickly it all went down.</p>

<p>Oddly enough she started with no anaesthetic at all until I asked for some when
she was getting near the nerve. I expected maybe this was a cost thing and I&#8217;d
have to pay more for the anaesthetic, but that didn&#8217;t seem to be the case.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the dentist didn&#8217;t have time to do the replacement fillings the
same day, so she put in a temporary one for me for the night.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614829080/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Leon Cathedral by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7574/15614829080_e57a1085d5_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Leon Cathedral" class="img-responsive"><em>Leon Cathedral</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went back the next day and got the two fillings replaced properly, one in the
morning and one in the afternoon. She said the ones I had were terrible, which I
thought so myself. Apparently there&#8217;s some sort of laboratory filling you can
get that the dentist thinks I should look into in the next few years. I was a
bit unclear on some of that, since she only spoke Spanish and these aren&#8217;t the
kind of words you learn at language school.</p>

<p>The dental work seemed great for the money (less than $100), although I now have
a gap between those two teeth that never used to be there, which gets food stuck
in it anytime I eat, which is super annoying. I&#8217;ve never really worried about
flossing since my teeth are all so close together that stuff never really gets
between them, but now I need to do that one gap every time I eat :/</p>

<p>While I was in Leon I tried to book a tour up to Volcan Telicia, one of the
Volcanoes where you can actually see glowing lava, but apparently I was the only
person who signed up so it didn&#8217;t go ahead. Disappointed. Some day I&#8217;ll see lava
glowing.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15799583825/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Flor de Ca&#xF1;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7541/15799583825_0eef790935_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Flor de Ca&#xF1;a" class="img-responsive"><em>Flor de Ca&#xF1;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>Instead I took myself out to the Flor de Caña factory to do a tour of that. For
those who know, Flor de Caña is a rum made in Nicaragua, and it&#8217;s really damn
tasty stuff. I&#8217;d never really drunk much rum before coming to Nicaragua, but I
drank a lot of it while I was there and learned an appreciation for the good
stuff, straight up.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614818680/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Molasses Vats by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7485/15614818680_85e5723845_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Molasses Vats" class="img-responsive"><em>Molasses Vats</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was a pretty cosy tour, just me and two American brothers. We drove past the
giant vats of molasses, each holding 1,000,000 litres of molasses. I couldn&#8217;t
help but imagine the thought of a vat failure, and molasses running everywhere
very slowly.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of interesting stuff about rum on the tour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was told that white rum loses it&#8217;s colour due to the filtration process they
use.</li>
  <li>They claim they just put alcohol in the barrels, not rum. Then being in the
barrels is what makes it into rum.</li>
  <li>6% of the barrel volume is lost to evaporation every year, meaning that to end
up with a decent volume of aged rum, you need to start with a whole lot more.</li>
  <li>25 years is the oldest rum that they make, which is also the age of a barrel
that needs replacing and around about the time the civil issues in Nicaragua
were settling down.</li>
  <li>The barrels are bought from American whiskey companies, I saw both Jim Beam
and Wild Turkey labels. The barrels are all stripped down and rebuilt before
use.</li>
  <li>They make some big environmental claims, claiming they use 100% renewable
energy from burning sugar cane husk, do an epic amount of recycling, lots more
I don&#8217;t remember now. Seems to be at odds with the views I&#8217;d heard previously
about how evil they were and are killing their workers.</li>
</ul>

<p>We did a tasting of the 18 year old rum in this beautiful room that used to be a
cellar, with furniture made from the wood of old rum barrels. It was really
pretty but they wouldn&#8217;t allow photos down there :( I&#8217;ll never understand why
that&#8217;s a thing.  They showed us how the 18 year old has no remaining sugars, by
getting us to put a little bit in the palm of our hands and rub it dry, showing
that it really doesn&#8217;t leave any sticky residue.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15799662315/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Tiny tour group by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5605/15799662315_e615a4b10a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Tiny tour group" class="img-responsive"><em>Tiny tour group</em></a></span></p>

<p>Later at the end of the tour we got to try the 7 year old with soda, but I&#8217;d
already drank plenty of that. What I really wanted was to try the 25 year old,
even if I had to buy a nip of it, but it was only on offer by the bottle for
$161. Just a wee bit out of my budget. For reference, in Nicaragua the 7 year
old can be found for $7-9, the 18 year old is about $40. There really is a huge
jump in price for those last 7 years of aging!</p>

<p>And that finally wraps up Nicaragua!</p>

<p>After leaving La Mariposa, I headed to the island of Ometepe and met up with
some friends from La Mariposa who were staying at an old farm house called Finca
Magdelena. It was just $6 a night for a private room, and they made amazing
French toast that I had for breakfast most days.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Mostly I just relaxed, caught up on reading, and worked through some of  my
Spanish workbook. Occasionally I even left the farm!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15452118857/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Ojo de agua by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3956/15452118857_80083c1b67_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ojo de agua" class="img-responsive"><em>Ojo de agua</em></a></span></p>

<p>One day we made a trip to Ojo de Agua (Eye of the water), a beautiful green
freshwater pool build over the source of a naturally occurring mineral stream.
Lovely clear water, probably 50M long and deep enough to really swim laps. I
could open my eyes underwater and see quite clearly, no stinging at all. The
pool combined with a few &#8220;coco locos&#8221; was an enjoyable way to spend the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15018262093/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Getting smashed by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3941/15018262093_ddc8430f6b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Getting smashed by the waterfall" class="img-responsive"><em>Getting smashed by the waterfall</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day, Andrei, Morgan and myself went for a hike to see a waterfall with
some local guides. It was a reasonably long walk up the hill to what turned out
to be a small but refreshing waterfall.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15017671414/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Our guides and their noisey car speaker by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3941/15017671414_133331e863_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Our guides and their noisey car speaker" class="img-responsive"><em>Our guides and their noisey car speaker</em></a></span></p>

<p>One guide had one of the toy car speakers that every Nicaraguan seems to own.
Turning it on plays a loud engine revving sound and a horn honking, and then
starts blaring the owners taste in music through a tinny speaker with massive
levels of distortion. Really painful to listen to, and he kept turning it on at
really inappropriate times too; oh look there&#8217;s a nice bird, I bet he wants to
hear the shitty car make some noise, oh no, he&#8217;s flown off. I was silently
thrilled when the batteries died. Good riddance.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15639281572/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Stilling moonshine by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3947/15639281572_e79957326c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Stilling moonshine" class="img-responsive"><em>Stilling moonshine</em></a></span></p>

<p>On the walk back down we stopped in at a little house with an illegal still
making moonshine. Andrei got a drink bottle full of the stuff, but my goodness
did it taste awful!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15459758699/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Looking out from half way up Maderas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3949/15459758699_cb68988ba5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Looking out from half way up Maderas" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking out from half way up Maderas</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day I hiked halfway up Volcan Maderas to the lookout, a nice view of
Volcan Concepción. I left at 11, back down by 1:45-2, which seemed like pretty
good time, I&#8217;d heard 2 hours each way. the last few hundreds metres before the
lookout to Concepción was really tough; super slippery and wet. Not super muddy
by that point, but I could already tell my shoes wouldn&#8217;t be up to the whole
climb. I&#8217;m ok with that since everyone I spoke to who had gone to the top said:
a) it was bullshit hard for the second half of the climb and worse for the
decent, and b) there was no view at the top. Half way was plenty for me!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15622780706/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Melinda up at tree by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5605/15622780706_80e62e9251_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Melinda up at tree" class="img-responsive"><em>Melinda up at tree</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a while I started to feel like I had gotten stuck on the island. When a
nice girl named Melinda who I met at the farm was leaving, I decided to go and
travel with her for a few days. If not for her, I might still be on Ometepe
today.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15647332352/in/set-72157648995463971" title="The ugly ass cross on the hill at Jinotega by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5604/15647332352_9fdf2081c6_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The ugly ass cross on the hill at Jinotega" class="img-responsive"><em>The ugly ass cross on the hill at Jinotega</em></a></span></p>

<p>We headed up into the hills of Jinotega, home of this gaudy cross, decked
out with spectacular florescent tubes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15018150423/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Chicken bus fun with Morgan and Andrei by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5616/15018150423_f6ac26ae92_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chicken bus fun with Morgan and Andrei" class="img-responsive"><em>Chicken bus fun with Morgan and Andrei</em></a></span></p>

<p>Travelling around Nicaragua, I just about entirely got places using the chicken
buses. these are the old USA school buses, often pimped out with fancy paint
jobs and blinking lights. I was really impressed by their frequency, I don&#8217;t
think I ever had to wait more than an hour for one, even without ever checking a
timetable. I managed to cover some fairly large distances in a day without much
planning. Luggage would go up on the roof most of the time, sometimes with
people bringing all sorts of strange things to go up there. One time that stands
out in my memory, we stopped somewhere and some guys were loading ceramic pots
and vases onto the bus roof, actually throwing them up one at a time to someone
on the roof. I was waiting for someone to miss catching one but they seem like
they do this sort of thing all the time.</p>

<p>Melinda had to go to El Salvador to get her flight home, so I met up with some
new people and we headed over to Somoto to go and check out Somoto Canyon. I&#8217;d
never been canyoning before, and it turns out that it&#8217;s awesome fun!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15646709545/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Hiking into Somoto Canyon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5609/15646709545_455161bf3d_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hiking into Somoto Canyon" class="img-responsive"><em>Hiking into Somoto Canyon</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the canyon there&#8217;s an unofficial guide office right on the highway where
loads of people hassle you, but we went further down the path and found the real
place, where the money is actually shared among the all the guides and a portion
goes to support the local community. We got a guide named Ramone and his uncle Trino, both of whom were really nice.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15460084789/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Somoto Canyon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7526/15460084789_befd8f6ac7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Somoto Canyon" class="img-responsive"><em>Somoto Canyon</em></a></span></p>

<p>The hike into the canyon was about 1km of walking in the hot sun before we got
wet for the first time. The cool water of the river flowing through the canyon
was super refreshing.  Initially we were just wading through ankle deep water,
but soon enough it got deeper and we were waist deep, and then not much later is
was too deep to touch and we were swimming down the canyon.</p>

<p>During the day we alternated between rock hopping, hiking, swimming, and
climbing over precariously steep rock faces.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15026603033/in/set-72157648995463971" title="First jump by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7519/15026603033_6bbc1d97b9_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="First jump" class="img-responsive"><em>First jump</em></a></span></p>

<p>We jumped off 3 rocks into the water below throughout the day. The first was
probably 4-5 meters, and my feet hit the bottom pretty firmly. Glad I wasn&#8217;t
stupid enough to dive!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15461202130/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Still falling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7464/15461202130_538b51639f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Still falling" class="img-responsive"><em>Still falling</em></a></span></p>

<p>The Second place was in a deeper part of the canyon, maybe a 6-8 M drip and it
seemed like a huge jump at the time.  It was a difficult scramble to get back up
from the lower pool to the rock again, but it was fun so we jumped off this one
twice.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15026678733/in/set-72157648995463971" title="The high jump by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7524/15026678733_f8eb3d11c3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The high jump" class="img-responsive"><em>The high jump</em></a></span></p>

<p>The third and final place was 20 M further along the canyon, a big 10 M drop. The
jump itself wasn&#8217;t too bad, I had a little fear before I jumped but it was fine
once I was in the air.  The terrifying part was the climb up to get to the spot
to jump from. It involved climbing up a pretty shear rock face without great
foot or hand holds, wearing shoes. It was quite challenging to not slip and fall
and hurt ourselves. Compared to the climb, jumping was easy.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15460921427/in/set-72157648995463971" title="The end of the canyon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7522/15460921427_d2ba31baa8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The end of the canyon" class="img-responsive"><em>The end of the canyon</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the canyon we saw lots of groups of Nicaraguans on the short tour
(we&#8217;d opted for the long one because you get to see a lot more of the canyon.
Apparently not many locals do the medium or long tour because they can&#8217;t swim.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15460782828/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Paddle boats by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5604/15460782828_14e827449f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Paddle boats" class="img-responsive"><em>Paddle boats</em></a></span></p>

<p>For the last little part of the canyon, we loaded 15 people into a tiny little
boat, to get us past the last long bit of river. With that many people in the
boat it was barely above water. Not sure how it would have ended with a bunch of
people who cant swim if anything had happened.</p>

<p>While studying at La Mariposa I got to take advantage of a lot of free
excursions to cool places around Nicaragua. Here&#8217;s a few of my favourites from
the month there.</p>

<h1 id="granada">Granada</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15471831282/in/set-72157648514224155" title="So many senseless deaths by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2950/15471831282_1eabd319ee_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So many senseless deaths" class="img-responsive"><em>So many senseless deaths</em></a></span></p>

<p>First stop for the day was the cemetery, where we saw the graves of a huge
number of young people who had died in the contra war. It was really sad to
think of how many young men never lived to see 20, fighting in that war. We
learnt that &#8220;burial&#8221; plots (most of which are actually chambers above ground)
are rented out, and when the family of the deceased can&#8217;t afford to pay anymore,
the body gets moved out so another one can take it&#8217;s place.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15285634408/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Cigar rolling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5600/15285634408_4d15948939_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Cigar rolling" class="img-responsive"><em>Cigar rolling</em></a></span></p>

<p>We made a visit to a cigar factory and saw how the cigars are made, using 5
kinds of leaves and a press. It was quite impressive to see how quickly they
could roll one up, then finish it off in the press.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15472286615/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Smoking a cigar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2948/15472286615_01a421445d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Smoking a cigar" class="img-responsive"><em>Smoking a cigar</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the big fat cigars and one of the thin ones were passed around for the
group to try. I thought the thin one was much nicer, but both left a terrible
stale smoke taste in my mouth.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15285398819/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Me and a McCaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5607/15285398819_9659d2fe33_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me and a McCaw" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and a McCaw</em></a></span></p>

<p>The cigar factory was also home to a huge scarlet macaw who was quite tame.
Andrei took this great photo with him on my shoulder.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15472351685/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Colonial houses by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2950/15472351685_2741f89c77_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Colonial houses in front of a volcano" class="img-responsive"><em>Colonial houses in front of a volcano</em></a></span></p>

<p>We climbed up the bell tower of the old cathedral to look out over the city.
It gave a nice view of  one of the volcanoes, and allowed you to see all the
colonial style court yards in many of the old houses.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15472204492/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Boat tour by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3932/15472204492_03a53984a7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Boat tour" class="img-responsive"><em>Boat tour</em></a></span></p>

<p>After lunch we took a boat ride out among the 365 islands surrounding Granada in
Largo Nicaragua. Some of them are tiny, while others are fairly sizable. There
were many, many houses out there, some very fancy holiday homes among them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15449400236/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Monkeys! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3929/15449400236_54fd53d0a4_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Monkeys!" class="img-responsive"><em>Monkeys!</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the islands is dubbed &#8220;monkey island&#8221;. It is home to a number of
rehabilitated monkeys, apparently put there by a vet. There were 3 spider monkeys
and a white faced one. The way the spider monkeys move is just like in the
cartoons, using their tail as if it were just a 5th arm. Apparently the monkeys
get fed regularly by the vet as the island does not grow food they eat. The
spider monkeys are quite curious and they all come out on the outer branches of
the trees and look at passing boats.</p>

<p>We stopped at a bar on one of the islands for a cold drink and a swim in the
lake. There was a sprung diving board which made for some fun jumping into the
lake, which was a beautiful temperature. Most of the swimming I&#8217;d done on this
trip had been in salt water, so it was interesting to see how much more easily I
sank in fresh water.</p>

<h1 id="volcan-masaya">Volcan Masaya</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898349376/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Smoking volcano crater by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5595/14898349376_1c716d46db_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Smoking volcano crater" class="img-responsive"><em>Smoking volcano crater</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the afternoon trips was to see an active volcano. It&#8217;s not actually
Volcan Masaya, which is apparently the dormant crater next to the Santiago
crater.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s definitely the easiest volcano you can summit, with the car park being
right on the crater rim.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734672750/in/set-72157646060932408" title="So smokey by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5590/14734672750_b3264785ed_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So smokey" class="img-responsive"><em>So smokey</em></a></span></p>

<p>The day we visited it was pumping out a lot of cloudy gas; enough to block out
the sun. This also meant we couldn&#8217;t see much in the volcano. I&#8217;m told that the
lava at the bottom is about 120°C, which sounds pretty hot, but another one in
Nicaragua is supposed to be 400°C and glow much more brightly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734707909/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Walking up to the mirador by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3903/14734707909_c649759ed6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Walking up to the mirador" class="img-responsive"><em>Walking up to the mirador</em></a></span></p>

<p>We walked to a few different view points, then went up a nearby hill which
passed the dormant Masaya volcano.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734767028/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5559/14734767028_d85f13f09c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>We watched the sunset from the top of the hill, with the gases from the volcano
giving us beautiful oranges, purples and blues.</p>

<p>After sunset, we went to the mouth of a cave after sunset, where tons of bats
flying out to do their thing for the evening. It&#8217;s amazing how fast they fly and
yet how rarely they collide with anything.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14921400105/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Hard hat zone by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3868/14921400105_f166c4387a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Hard hat zone" class="img-responsive"><em>Hard hat zone</em></a></span></p>

<p>We put on safety hats and got torches, and went 180M down into another tunnel
which was formed by lava flow &#8220;recently&#8221; (800 years?). Pretty cool to see all
the blue volcanic stone and bubbles. Tree roots were creeping in from the
ceiling giving it a fantastical sort of feeling. When we reached the deepest
point in the cave that we would visit, we all turned off our torches briefly to
experience total darkness. Spoiler: it was black.</p>

<h1 id="la-boquita">La Boquita</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898423946/in/set-72157646060932408" title="La Boquita by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5565/14898423946_5f76a44c76_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="La Boquita" class="img-responsive"><em>La Boquita</em></a></span></p>

<p>One Saturday we went to visit a beach down on the Pacific coast named La
Boquita. It was a blistering hot day, which mostly consisted of sitting around
chatting with people in the shade, lying in hammocks reading, having a swim in
the waves, and eating seafood for lunch.</p>

<p>There were quite large and powerful waves with a fair bit of current. It was
loads of fun to bodysurf in, although it was pretty hard to keep your head up
when riding a wave and I did get tumbled over in somersaults involuntarily a
number of times.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734844617/in/set-72157646060932408" title="La Boquita by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5569/14734844617_4928b29d29_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="La Playa" class="img-responsive"><em>La Playa</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went out in the water with Kimberly and her son, Finn, a few times to put
Kim&#8217;s mind at ease about having an 8 year old in the water. Finn was determined
that he wanted to go out further, much to Kim&#8217;s dismay. We took him out pretty
far (for an 8 year old) and he seemed to be having a great time.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#8217;m finally starting to come around to kids a bit. I still don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ll ever want one, but I think I&#8217;m reaching a point where it won&#8217;t grate
on me to spend time around them once they&#8217;re past the screaming poo factory
stages. Maybe being an uncle some day would be cool.</p>

<p>I had delicious ceviche for lunch (raw fish which is &#8220;cooked&#8221; using the acidity
of lemon juice, no heat involved), then was fed leftover fish from everyone
else&#8217;s enormous lunches. Thanks guys!</p>

<h1 id="horseback-riding">Horseback Riding</h1>

<p>One Sunday morning I went horseback riding with two other students, Nicole and
Caitlin, on some of the horses that live on the school&#8217;s farm.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918342771/in/set-72157646060932408" title="I'm on a horse by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5556/14918342771_ed49e169d2_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="I'm on a horse" class="img-responsive"><em>I&#8217;m on a horse</em></a></span></p>

<p>The horses looked to be well cared for, we climbed on and were given zero
instructions, so Nicole (an experienced rider) and one of the guides were off
out in front while the rest of us trotted along quite slowly, but still at a
much more consistent pace than the poor pony I rode in Thailand years ago that
only wanted to stop.</p>

<p>After a while we regrouped and took a break, and Nicole gave me a brief rundown
of how to tell the horse what I wanted it to do, and I suddenly found that the
horse was actually very good at doing what it was told. I was much more able to
keep up and even led for a bit.</p>

<p>On a open flat patch I got the horse up to a decent speed, maybe a canter? It
was novel to see how suddenly the ride became much smoother than when we&#8217;d been
moving at a slower pace.</p>

<p>At this new faster pace I was a little scared at first, until I remembered being
told I could wrap my legs around the horses belly to secure myself a little
better, after which it stopped feeling like I was going to bounce off.</p>

<p>All up we rode for a bit over an hour, and after getting the hang of it it was
lots of fun.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14921422575/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Baby horse by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3841/14921422575_94bc6d51a4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Baby horse" class="img-responsive"><em>Baby horse</em></a></span></p>

<p>When we were done we went into the stables and saw a baby foal, barely a few
months old. Tiny horses are very cute!</p>

<p>Around this point I started to sneeze quite violently and repeatedly. My nose
has been a bit twichy before then, but being the in stables seemed to put me
over the edge and into a sneezing fit. Pretty sure I have an allergy to horses
as the sneezing lessened when I went away, but my ichy eyes and a blocked nose
were barely helped by antihistamines later. It kind of sucks to find a new
activity you enjoy, only to find it causes you a lot of other discomfort.</p>

<h1 id="managua">Managua</h1>

<p>On another afternoon excursion I visited the Capital of Nicaragua, Managua, with
Debra, Caitlin and Amanda. There&#8217;s a lot of concrete in the capital, and as such
it feel like it&#8217;s a billion degrees even though it&#8217;s only an hour away from the
relatively cool school.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734896177/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Very old human footprints by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3918/14734896177_546e15f5cc_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Very old human footprints" class="img-responsive"><em>Very old human footprints</em></a></span></p>

<p>We visited a museum with fossilised footprints, some of the oldest known
footprints on earth, thought to have been created by people evacuating from an
erupting volcano through the mud, with the volcanic ash promptly filling them,
preserving them for centuries.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734906928/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Church ruin left by the earthquake by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3840/14734906928_ea74d3b792_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Church ruin left by the earthquake" class="img-responsive"><em>Church ruin left by the earthquake</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went to the National Museum, which fronted onto a big square next to a leafy
park and the skeleton of a cathedral, made structurally unsound in the big
earthquake in 1979.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735333247/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Laguna poluto by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3880/14735333247_aeaa7bd994_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Laguna polluto" class="img-responsive"><em>Laguna polluto</em></a></span></p>

<p>We also visited the site of Samoza&#8217;s palace site, which has a lookout over the
city, and on the other side into a laguna, which is apparently still
suffering the pollution from dumping sewerage into it during Samoza&#8217;s reign.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735325407/in/set-72157646060932408" title="The basement of Samozsa's Palace by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3869/14735325407_e833c446ee_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The basement of Samoza's Palace" class="img-responsive"><em>The basement of Samoza&#8217;s Palace</em></a></span></p>

<p>The only thing left of Samoza&#8217;s palace was the basement, although the other
walls are opened up now and it is now home to a Sandinista museum.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735343797/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Pretty lights by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3853/14735343797_69065af209_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pretty lights" class="img-responsive"><em>Pretty lights</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went capped off the day going out for dinner at a restaurant by the lake. The
wind coming of the lake made the heat fade away, and it was a lovely evening of
nice food, good rum, and great company.</p>

<h1 id="len">León</h1>

<p>Another weekend trip, a visit to León required an early start to the day,
getting up at 5:30 to head to the Mariposa to start the long bus ride to León.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14921591022/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Largo Managua by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3860/14921591022_1724ac5fec_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Largo Managua" class="img-responsive"><em>Largo Managua</em></a></span></p>

<p>We stopped along the way next to lake Managua to have a look at the view of
Momotombo, one of the many volcanoes across Nicaragua.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735275559/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Quecillo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5553/14735275559_17f2a89847_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Quecillo" class="img-responsive"><em>Quecillo</em></a></span></p>

<p>We made another stop just outside of León to buy quesillos for breakfast. They
basically a tortilla wrapped around a hunk of cheese (kind of like feta), put in
a little plastic bag and drowned in runny cheese liquid. I ended up having two
because they were so good.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15469512481/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Weaving on table looms by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3941/15469512481_96a4d84c36_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Weaving on table looms" class="img-responsive"><em>Weaving on table looms</em></a></span></p>

<p>First stop in León was at a family weaving co op, which uses hand operated table
looms to make woven fabrics. We were shown how they make some of the detailed
patterned fabrics using a more complicated loom with four pedals pressed in
different orders. Quite clever stuff!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15449613506/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Up on the roof of the cathedral by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3947/15449613506_062ae62186_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Up on the roof of the cathedral" class="img-responsive"><em>Up on the roof of the cathedral</em></a></span></p>

<p>Next we went to León cathedral, a huge big building currently in the process of
being repainted white. We were able to pay and go up to the roof but it was not
your normal bell tower climb. We went up some narrow stairs next to a 2 story
drop with no hand railing, then out onto the big cylindrical rooftop with no
visible railings to stop you falling off the side of the building if you
slipped. We got a nice view of the city, but I was more surprised/impressed by
the fact we were allowed up there at all. No liability issues here I guess!</p>

<p>Outside the church was big mural that graphically covers the history of
Nicaragua. By this point I was starting to actually feel like I knew a lot of
the important bits of the story, although I suck at remembering specific names
and dates.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15286043650/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Paper mache figures by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3930/15286043650_38d137a8b8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Paper mache figures" class="img-responsive"><em>Paper mache figures</em></a></span></p>

<p>After lunch we went to the museum of Myths and Legends. It is hosted in a
building than used to be an old jail, opened in 1921 and closed in 1979. It
contained lots of mannequins of famous Nicaraguans, which if believed to be
anatomically accurate tell us that the famous poet Ruben Dario had a tiny little head.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15286192457/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Skeletons by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3946/15286192457_418ca40d69_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Skeletons" class="img-responsive"><em>Skeletons</em></a></span></p>

<p>Lots of the myths sounded like they were made up to scare children and husbands
into behaving themselves. Nicaraguans seem to be very superstitious. A golden
crab seemed to show up a lot, with various versions of the tale saying if you
caught him you&#8217;d either have something great happen to you, or something
terrible, depending on which story you believed. Nice and consistent.</p>

<h1 id="laguna-apoyo">Laguna Apoyo</h1>

<p>The last excursion, which I actually stayed an extra few days to go along on,
was to Laguna Apoyo, a volcanic crater, now filled with water forming a lake.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735363988/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Laguna Apoyo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3853/14735363988_fc13c94049_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Laguna Apoyo" class="img-responsive"><em>Laguna Apoyo</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was a very chilled day of relaxing in the sun. I spent quite a while out
floating on the lake in a tire tube, which was more effort than you&#8217;d expect
since wind blowing over the surface of the lake was causing waves to form and
take me back towards the shore.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898987456/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Laguna Apoyo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3849/14898987456_62917d3981_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Laguna Apoyo" class="img-responsive"><em>Laguna Apoyo</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was nice to spend a last day together with my Mariposa friends, chatting,
eating lunch, and resting in the sun. A perfect way to end of month of fairly
intense learning.</p>

<p>One of the goal I set for myself that I wanted to achieve in my travels was to
learn a second language. Years ago, right after living in Europe (where every
other person you meet seems to speak 4 languages) I had a go at learning Spanish
in Melbourne but I never found the opportunity to practice outside of class and
my interest waned. Being in Latin America it seemed like a good time to try
again.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I had heard about a school in Nicaragua near Masaya called &#8220;La Mariposa&#8221; from
Nick at Poi Love Camp. I did a bit of my own research and the place looked
really good, so I signed up for a month of intensive lessons.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898204176/in/set-72157646060932408" title="One of the many paths at in the school forest by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3916/14898204176_d012b81354_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="One of the many paths at in the school forest" class="img-responsive"><em>One of the many paths at in the school forest</em></a></span></p>

<p>The school is set amongst it&#8217;s own little plot of forest with all kinds of
plants and flowers growing, and quite a few coffee plants too. There were little
sheltered structures around the forests in which the classes often took place</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734681567/in/set-72157646060932408" title="P1200563.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3862/14734681567_ceccfd311c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="P1200563.jpg" class="img-responsive"><em>P1200563.jpg</em></a></span></p>

<p>The place was full of rescue animals. I think there were 11-12 rescue dogs on
the school grounds alone (there was a separate farm that I think had another
20 or so dogs), a number of cats, there was some rescued white-headed capuchin
monkeys, and lots of birds including a pair of beautiful toucans.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898247896/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Sleeping dogs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5596/14898247896_c6a9620dbe_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Sleeping dogs" class="img-responsive"><em>Sleeping dogs</em></a></span></p>

<p>All the dogs seemed to be totally friendly to any of the students, from the
first moment they arrived, but when a unknown local showed up they would all
bark like crazy. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s because Nicaraguan don&#8217;t treat dogs very well.</p>

<p>There was one old senile dog who I took a real liking too, who would just
randomly bark at nothing, sitting happily and calmly between barks. He&#8217;d
sometimes set off all the other dogs, and then just go back to sitting and
smiling. Maybe he thought he was telling the turkeys to stay in their turkey
enclosure, I don&#8217;t know :P</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734617077/in/set-72157646060932408" title="My Caba&#xF1;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5584/14734617077_07b32f0275_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My Caba&#xF1;a" class="img-responsive"><em>My Caba&#xF1;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>I initially chose to stay in their very nice private cabaña because I didn&#8217;t feel
like I&#8217;d have enough language to do a homestay. The cabaña was lovely, away from
the school and the hotel buildings, out in the forest so you could hear all
sorts of animal sounds in the evenings. It was a little 2 storey building made
of a material like bamboo, comprising of three separate rooms for students. The
walls were full of gaps so it was pretty much open air. There was a mosquito net
but after a few nights I started to wonder if it was even needed, tried sleeping
one night without it and found I didn&#8217;t get any bites so I stopped using it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918206221/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Tailles whip scorpion by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3854/14918206221_e947eaa47f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Tailles whip scorpion" class="img-responsive"><em>Tailles whip scorpion</em></a></span></p>

<p>One night I had what I thought was a spider come out in the cabaña, and I made a
deal with him that if he didn&#8217;t move he could stay. I looked away for a while
and he disappeared, but I heard he visited the next person who stayed too. I
showed the photo to a guy who knows about bugs and it turns out he&#8217;s not a
spider, but a tailless whip scorpion. I found another one in the shower one
night and saw him move, and these guy can move crazy fast!</p>

<p>Mornings I would wake to the sound of all the birds making as much noise as they
could. I was quite surprised to find out that toucans actually make a sound that
sounds like a frog croaking. I don&#8217;t know what sound I expected them to make,
but that wasn&#8217;t it!</p>

<p>There was constant stream of interesting people coming and going each week, far
too numerous to try and list. Everyone from students to doctors, landscape
designers to masseuses. There was a huge cross sections of ages from children
all the way through to retirees. Everyone I met was really interesting, coming
from all walks of life with all different motivations for learning Spanish. I
think the people really made the month for me and I hope to run into many
of you again in the future.</p>

<p>All meals were provided at the school, a delicious buffet of mostly vegetarian
cuisine. Beans and rice were a staple, but there was a nice selection of salad
and other vegetables too, and occasionally some chicken. Everything looked so
tasty that you never felt guilty about going back for seconds when there was
enough. Maybe a dangerous illusion!</p>

<p>The intensive lessons consisted of four hours of 1-on-1 classes per day, five
days a week. The time was split into two hours of grammar, and two hours of
conversation. You got a new conversation teacher each week, but kept the same
grammar teacher throughout unless you ask to change.</p>

<p>I initially got a grammar teacher who spoke absolutely no English, and was
hopeful that it would mean I&#8217;d have no choice but to pick things up quickly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898236806/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Chooks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3876/14898236806_a366d33a74_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Chooks" class="img-responsive"><em>Chooks</em></a></span></p>

<p>It turns out that&#8217;s not the way my brain works at all, and I just found myself
frustrated to no end by not having my questions answered because my Spanish wasn&#8217;t
good enough to express them; And so I changed after the first week to someone
who had at least a little bit of English.</p>

<p>Maybe it works for some people, but when it comes to something dry, complicated
and arbitrary like grammar, I feel being able to ask &#8220;why?&#8221;, even if the answer
is just &#8220;because that&#8217;s how it is&#8221; is very important. Asking why about something
specific that&#8217;s bothering you, and then having the high-level basic concept
repeated at me more loudly and more slowly just made me frustrated and put me in
a state where I didn&#8217;t seem to absorb any new information.</p>

<p>My other grammar teacher suited me much better, although I feel that learning
grammar in such a robotic way isn&#8217;t really ideal for me. There must be a better
way, since I can speak English without really knowing the grammar. I actually
questioned my English teaching mother why I don&#8217;t remember ever formally
learning English grammar and apparently they phased it out when <em>she</em> was a
child, in favour of teaching it through immersion. Hence why I can&#8217;t say why
something is correct or incorrect English, but I can tell you when something
sounds wrong.</p>

<p>My conversation classes were much more enjoyable, covering all sorts of topics
from how life in Australia differs to Nicaragua (a lot), the government, to drug
policies and illegal animal fighting. It was good having a new teacher every
week to keep the conversations fresh.</p>

<p>Classes where pretty flexible; if you wanted to make a trip into town you could
do so with your teacher in tow, allowing you to ask questions and come across
conversation topics that you might not otherwise think of. I even interrupted one
class to buy my ticket to Burning Man. A good thing I did too, since they sold
out in 45 minutes; it definitely couldn&#8217;t have waited until after class.</p>

<p>Pretty much every afternoon, and full days on weekends, the school ran
activities that you could go along on.  Activities included things like visiting
a nearby nature reserve, trips to nearby cities (Leon, Managua, Masaya,
Granada), dinners out, visiting local volcanoes, a trip to the beach, horseback
riding, a tour of an organic dried fruit processing plant, a visit to Laguna
Apoyo and salsa classes.</p>

<p>Initially I went along to way too many activities, and felt that I did not have
enough time for study. Later started being a bit more picky and choosier so I
could try and be a good student too.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735343797/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Pretty lights by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3853/14735343797_de55c0b041_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pretty lights" class="img-responsive"><em>Pretty lights</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of my favourite regular activities was the weekly talk about the history of
Nicaragua, spoken in very clear, slow Spanish, then translated into English for
those of us without enough vocabulary yet. It was great to see my comprehension
progress each week and it was really interesting to learn about Nicaraguan
history, and made visiting a lot of historic sites more interesting because I
actually knew the stories behind them.</p>

<p>About half way through the month I decided that staying at the school in the
cabaña was letting me be lazy and speak too much English with other students, so
I asked if I could move into a homestay.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918977571/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Jamy, Paola and Camila by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3838/14918977571_207c20c6c7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Jamy, Paola and Camila" class="img-responsive"><em>Jamy, Paola and Camila</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got placed in a home with host mother Jamy, whose daughter Paola and son-in-law
live with them, along with their 2 year old child Camila. Camila was very shy
the first night I arrived, not even saying &#8220;hola&#8221;, but warmed right up to me the
next day, trying to show me every one of her toys, one by one (btw, to a 2 year
old a deck of cards is 52 toys), and by the end I was &#8220;Tio Lucas&#8221;. So cute!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735355189/in/set-72157646060932408" title="My homestay house by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3916/14735355189_9d270afc6a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My homestay house" class="img-responsive"><em>My homestay house</em></a></span></p>

<p>The house was a fairly traditional Nicaraguan house, quite rustic and open,
walls without ceilings under the roof so it was nice and airy. The area, San
Juan de la Concepción, is in drought so they only have running water a few times
per week, which mean that the toilet was flushed with buckets, and showers were
also of the bucket variety. It&#8217;s amazing how little water you really need to get
clean (although maybe I&#8217;d feel differently if I had long hair).</p>

<p>Homestay food was a bit different than food at La Mariposa. Lots of beans and
rice and chicken for dinner and eggs for breakfast. Nothing a bit of hot sauce
can&#8217;t salvage, but I did miss all the healthy veggies I had gotten used to. I
was glad that we still got lunch at the school, even in the homestay.</p>

<p>Noise levels in town during the nights wasn&#8217;t quite as serene as at the school.
It sounded like there were hundreds of dogs running around barking at each other
every single night. Endlessly. All night. I&#8217;m lucky enough to be a heavy
sleeper, so once I got to sleep I was fine.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14922026385/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Where I learnt how to do laundry with a wash board by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3839/14922026385_204520233b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Where I learnt how to do laundry with a wash board" class="img-responsive"><em>Where I learnt how to do laundry with a wash board</em></a></span></p>

<p>One weekend I asked Jamy to demonstrate for me how the old style washboard hand
washing laundry worked but she ended up doing pretty much all of my washing for
me! I did have a go and found that it&#8217;s harder work than it looks, although it&#8217;s
easier than hand washing in a bathroom sink.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my month my grammar teacher started to really pick up the
pace, sometimes covering two or three tenses in a day, getting right through to
the subjunctive. At the time I was thinking it was way more than I needed, but
I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s made revisiting those topics much easier as the seeds have
all been planted.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735484887/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Me and Paulette by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3874/14735484887_517a204416_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Me and Paulette, the woman behind the school" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and Paulette, the woman behind the school</em></a></span></p>

<p>By the end of a month of study I had learnt a lot of study, and a lot more about
how I learn. I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d be much better after a month, but I&#8217;m much slower
at learning spoken languages than I&#8217;m used to. With most other things, I feel
like I only need to be shown a quick over view and I can figure out the rest,
but with languages the way I think just doesn&#8217;t help. Too many exceptions to
rules, and too many irregularities for me to just &#8220;get a feel for it&#8221;. It feels
like I&#8217;m gonna have to ROTE learn a bunch of stuff if I&#8217;m ever going to get to
where I want to be. Looking at it as a challenge for myself; I need to figure
out something that works for me or I&#8217;ll bore myself to death with repetition :P</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535655259/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3835/14535655259_8660ab6035_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Montezuma sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>So after I was finished in Uvita I headed to the next place along the coast of
Costa Rica that seems to get rave reviews, Montezuma. Montezuma is described by
guidebooks and Lonely Planet tourists as some beautiful and undiscovered hippy
beach town, so I went there expecting maybe something like Byron Bay was 10-15
years ago.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I was sorely let down, and I feel all those people need a strong reality check.
The place is horribly overrun by tourists. It felt like the last real local had
left years ago and now there is nothing but pot smoking gringos, pretending
they&#8217;re in some hippy paradise. Or maybe that is hippy paradise, and I&#8217;m just
jaded. Having grown up close to both Byron Bay (when it was far less developed
than it is today) and Nimbin (where at least there are pot smoking locals too),
I felt Montezuma brought nothing of interest to the table.</p>

<p>I had a huge amount of trouble finding a decent room. Most places I tried were
full up, with the remaining places either being empty and super creepy, or
without lockers. Not cool at all with the reputation this place has specifically
for thieves breaking into hostel rooms. Eventually I found a place with room for
me but it was a complete dive.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535853397/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3870/14535853397_2cb0f86dc2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Montezuma" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma</em></a></span></p>

<p>I tried to switch hostels to one of the highly rated places the next day to see
if my opinion on the place would change, but they were full up again so I reserved a
bed for the following day after that.</p>

<p>I really tried to give the town a good chance, but even after moving hostels to
the fully booked one, no one was ever around. For a town that was full up in
terms of accommodation, it was strangely like a ghost town during the day. It
seemed like everyone staying in Montezuma disappeared off to snorkelling tours
or surfing lessons in other towns&#8230; Why exactly do people come here again?</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t all shit though.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719920754/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Cliff diving by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2920/14719920754_8811d76f8a_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Cliff diving" class="img-responsive"><em>Cliff diving</em></a></span></p>

<p>I decided to go see the waterfall, and that turned out to be really worthwhile.
The walk to the falls was pretty easy, a lot of rock hopping over the steam
leading away from the falls. The bottom fall was very beautiful, with lots of
people swimming in the pool at the bottom or sunning themselves on the
surrounding rocks. It looked like it would be very dangerous to jump off, but
that didn&#8217;t stop some folk.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535670980/in/set-72157645450071209" title="This was part of the path to the top by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2937/14535670980_401cf4fdec_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="This was part of the path to the top" class="img-responsive"><em>This was part of the path to the top</em></a></span></p>

<p>I climbed up to the top of the second fall via the alternate path. There were
some extremely steep parts where you only really had a rope to hold on to to
climb up and down, almost like abseiling. The path went up quite a bit higher
than the falls, around the side and then came back down to the top of the falls.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719940384/in/set-72157645450071209" title="A local jumping down the second falls by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3841/14719940384_922db43cea_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="A local jumping down the second falls" class="img-responsive"><em>A local jumping down the second falls</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were lots of people up there, some Ticos were jumping down the second
waterfall into the pool below it. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s 15M, and it looks like a fairly
safe jump straight down. I heard some long screams before they finally hit the
water. However, being a solo traveller with no one there to look out for me I wasn&#8217;t
willing to jump myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719914944/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma waterfall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3905/14719914944_1052cf80c1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Montezuma waterfall" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma waterfall</em></a></span></p>

<p>I climbed back down to the bottom falls, and went for a swim there. It was cool
that you could get right against the rocks, behind the water curtain and hear
the falls pounding down in front of you.</p>

<p>On my last night there, while wandering around the streets waiting to see the
fire show that happens on Thursday nights, I met a friendly American couple who
waiting for reggae night in one of the bars to start and spend the night talking
with them. It just so happened they were driving to Santa Teresa the next day
and so they offered me a lift there with them in their air conditioned 4WD.
Score! Sure beats the bus!</p>

<p>I found Santa Teresa to be a much nicer place than Montezuma. There&#8217;s a long
surf beach going for kilometres in either direction, mostly with a sandy bottom
perfect for learning.</p>

<p>I walked the whole length of the beach on the day I arrived to get an idea where
places were, all the way down to Playa Carmen; a long enough walk that my legs
were sore afterwards.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14699346436/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Boards in the surf shop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3910/14699346436_f7fe1aa431_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Boards in the surf shop" class="img-responsive"><em>Boards in the surf shop</em></a></span></p>

<p>I took a surf lesson with Al Chilli Surf Shop, with a group consisting of two
German girls and a Korean girl. We were shown how to jump up, practiced on the
sand a bunch of times and then went out into the surf with the instructor
holding the board and telling us to paddle and jump up as the waves came
through.</p>

<p>I managed to get up and ride the wave all the way in a few times, and towards
the end managed a few times completely unassisted; I was pretty happy with that!</p>

<p>I happened to be in Santa Teresa at the time of a full moon, and one of the
beach bars was having a big full moon party which I went along to with some
people from the hostel. It was a pretty big night with loads of people. I got to
practice some Spanish on some locals and didn&#8217;t get home until the sun was up.</p>

<p>I felt like crap the next day, awake by 9am because of the heat, but I went out
surfing anyway because I had 24 hours of free board rental with my lesson. I was
really struggling to paddle hard enough because I was so tired, but still got up
a few times.</p>

<p>I had not been paying enough attention and the current took me about a kilometre
down along the beach. When I came back in I had no idea where. It took me ages
to figure out which direction I needed to walk to get back, barefoot on the hot
road, then back down to the beach to get my flip-flops.</p>

<p>I went out again the next afternoon with a bit more energy and seemed to be
getting up a bit more easily, but most of the waves were just dumping over in
one go, so you couldn&#8217;t properly catch them.</p>

<p>I ran into Kaya, one of the German girls from the lesson, and her boyfriend
Francisco and hung out with them for the afternoon and organised to meet up
early the next day for a surf. I also went back to the shop and swapped out my
giant 2.8 metre board for an 2.6 metre one, to see how I went with a shorter one
the next day.</p>

<p>The next morning we were in the surf at 6am and the waves were pretty good for
about half an hour, but then the surf went flat so we went and had breakfast
together, before going our separate ways for the day, with me having a good nap.</p>

<p>I went back down to the beach at 3pm for another surf and the waves were much
better. I actually managed to catch a couple before they had fully broken, a
sensation that feels much faster and a whole lot more fun. I ran into Kaya and
Francisco again and it turned out they were heading up the peninsula in their
car the next day, the same direction as me, and offered me a lift to Liberia.
Score!</p>

<p>The drive up the peninsula had roads of quite varying quality. From Santa Teresa
to the close ferry port was pretty OK. From there to the far ferry port was
crazy bumpy and torn up so we crawled along very slowly for that part, but once
we were past there the roads were pretty great so we made good time.</p>

<p>Kaya and Francisco kindly dropped me off at a nice little hotel in Liberia,
where I spent my last night in Costa Rica before getting the bus to the
Nicaraguan border early in the morning.</p>
