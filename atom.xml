<p>My next destination was San Pedro La Laguna, a little town on the edge of Lake
Atitlan that I&#8217;d had recommendations about from numerous people I&#8217;d met in my
travels. I&#8217;d planned to go and study spanish there, and even had a
recommendation for a school from a girl I&#8217;d met in Antigua named Sue. Before I&#8217;d
even got my bag off the shuttle, I saw Sue walking by so she showed me the cheap
hotel she was staying in, but it was full so I went and got a bed somewhere
else.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16370752713/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Casa Rosario - my school by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8741/16370752713_e1b010e9e0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Casa Rosario - my school" class="img-responsive"><em>Casa Rosario - my school</em></a></span></p>

<p>I showed up at the school the next morning and was surprised that not only
Vecenti, the guy who runs it, could not only get me started with lessons that
day, but would be able to get someone in in half an hour and sort out a homestay
for me to stay in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16803061848/in/set-72157651239918317" title="My rooftop and room by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8704/16803061848_5879433708_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My rooftop and room" class="img-responsive"><em>My rooftop and room</em></a></span></p>

<p>My homestay family consisted of Gloria and Felix, the parents, their young son
Jose-Felix, their adult daughter and her husband. I had a room up on the roof
with a rooftop courtyard on one side and a semi-private bathroom on the other.
All meals except Sundays were provided, so it was an absolute bargain at just
$55 a week in addition to the $80 a week for one-on-one lessons, four hours per day.</p>

<p>The little boy, Jose-Felix, seemed to take a shine to me, always wanting to show
me the space ships he built from lego-like blocks and paper planes, and wanting
to show me how well he could read the stuff I was trying to read; so I was
definitely reading well below an 8 year old&#8217;s level at the time :P</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16989462492/in/set-72157651239918317" title="My neighbours guard duck by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8752/16989462492_980199e9aa_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My neighbours guard duck" class="img-responsive"><em>My neighbours guard duck</em></a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the family were friendly enough, although my limited spanish meant
all of the conversation was pretty superficial. Pretty much every meal came with
freshly made tortillas, Gloria would be slapping them out flat with her hands
and cooking them on the stove top before every meal. Meals were very, very carb
heavy, breakfast was often just bread rolls and a banana.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17001687332/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Lake Atitlan is rising by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7629/17001687332_1dbf762948_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lake Atitlan is rising" class="img-responsive"><em>Lake Atitlan is rising</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was apparently one of the rainy periods when I arrived, and so most afternoon
it would bucket down with rain turning the little narrow streets into nearly
knee deep rivers, so I&#8217;d hide out at a cafe and read while I waited for it to pass.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16370667803/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Lake Atitlan is rising by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8700/16370667803_8ba8708e5f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Lake Atitlan is rising" class="img-responsive"><em>Lake Atitlan is rising</em></a></span></p>

<p>The water level of the lake has apparently been steadily rising for the past 30
or so years, to the extent that a huge number of buildings are now partially
submerged underwater. It made for some rather captivating photos, but also added
some danger to swimming in certain areas as trees have died and been cut down
leaving only big stumps, which the water has then risen to cover. You&#8217;d be
swimming along and then, whack, you run right into a submerged stump. Luckily
there were some much deeper places to swim as well.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16803420260/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Treehouse at Casa Rosario by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7606/16803420260_1860127fb7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Treehouse at Casa Rosario" class="img-responsive"><em>Treehouse at Casa Rosario</em></a></span></p>

<p>Lessons at this school, Casa Rosario, were quite a bit different than at the
school I went to in Nicaragua. Things were a lot less structured, I could say
what areas I wanted to work on and we&#8217;d work on that. Initially I started off
really enjoying going over the stuff I didn&#8217;t even realise I already knew, but I
noticed a change in my mood when we got to stuff I started getting wrong where
I&#8217;d start to close up and become disinterested. Not very helpful behaviour when
I&#8217;m trying to learn something new.</p>

<p>I did learn quite a bit during the week of lessons, but I found the lack of
structure in the lesson content didn&#8217;t really work so well for me so I decided
not to stay for any more lessons after my first week.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17001720592/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Street festivities by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8697/17001720592_ae86fdc355_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Street festivities" class="img-responsive"><em>Street festivities</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next village over, San Juan, was having it&#8217;s yearly celebration for the
saint the village is named after, so my teacher and I had a very free form
lesson one day where we went over there and looked around, me asking questions
about the activities going on as a way to practice with more natural examples of
things to say and listen to.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16380822964/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Chicken float by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7647/16380822964_cab7db6769_c.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="Chicken float" class="img-responsive"><em>Chicken float</em></a></span></p>

<p>Each village on the lake has one of these kinds of festivals and it just so
happened that the one for San Pedro fell during the entire week I was there, so
the place was super busy, getting busier each day leading up to the peak on the
weekend. Stages were set up, the streets were lined with little stalls selling
all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>One of the traditions all through Guatemala seems to be setting off &#8220;bombas&#8221; to
celebrate. A bomba is basically a rocket firecracker. They drop an explosive in
a little steel contraption, kind of like a mortar launcher, and light the fuse,
then after a few seconds a huge bang sends the thing up in the air about 200
meters where the second explosion goes off even louder than the first. No pretty
streams of light or coloured flashes, just pure noise, and because it&#8217;s up so
high for the second bang the sound travels far and it&#8217;s loud all over town.
These things were being set off constantly, night and day; it was like being in
a warzone and it drove me crazy. One night at about 3:30am they let off 20-30 of
them all in the span of about 5 minutes. SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GO TO SLEEP!</p>

<p>I asked my family about them but all I could get from them was that it was
tradition. No real significance. They apparently cost $15-20 for the small ones,
so families pool money together to buy them. Seems like a great waste of money
in a place where people are so poor. Worse still, watching them actually be set
off near one of the nightly concerts I noticed that aside from us gringos,
nobody even seems to even react to them. These people need to be introduced to
fireworks, so at least there&#8217;s something to see.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17003240885/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Chips and juicebox float? by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8742/17003240885_83a6c4b643_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chips and juicebox float?" class="img-responsive"><em>Chips and juicebox float?</em></a></span></p>

<p>One one of the days there was a big parade through the town with all sorts of
floats. Giant chickens, giant ants, crazy costumes, and the strangest one, a
little girl sitting between to huge boxes made of chip packets and juice boxes.
No idea what it was supposed to be, maybe a big advertisement for the products?</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16815413398/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Volcan San Pedro from San Marcos by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8722/16815413398_d3221c2498_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Volcan San Pedro from San Marcos" class="img-responsive"><em>Volcan San Pedro from San Marcos</em></a></span></p>

<p>Early one morning I set off to climb Volcan San Pedro. It was a long and fairly
steep climb, 1.5 kilometres of vertical ascent in total with the top being 3050
metres above sea level (the lake itself is already 1.5 KM above sea level).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977329346/in/set-72157651239918317" title="We put the snake back on the path for the next person by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8718/16977329346_2dea1652ce_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="We put the snake back on the path for the next person" class="img-responsive"><em>We put the snake back on the path for the next person</em></a></span></p>

<p>Part way up the guide got a shock from a big long snake on the path, before
realising it was dead. He picked it up with a stick and gave us a better look at
it, then carefully put it back to freak out the next group. Nice gesture!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16817137849/in/set-72157651239918317" title="So very green! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8699/16817137849_36eed2f312_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So very green!" class="img-responsive"><em>So very green!</em></a></span></p>

<p>We were pretty slow going and it got pretty muddy and slippery as we neared the
top. The forest at the top was really beautiful and green, and smelt like a
forest should.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16817140679/in/set-72157651239918317" title="The view from the top - Cloudy by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8705/16817140679_424421f5c7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The view from the top - Cloudy" class="img-responsive"><em>The view from the top - Cloudy</em></a></span></p>

<p>When we reached the top, the view was a uniform white wall of cloud, so we sat
and rested and waited, hoping it might clear.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977371566/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Me at the top of Volcan San Pedro by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7614/16977371566_9e3b18f402_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me at the top of Volcan San Pedro" class="img-responsive"><em>Me at the top of Volcan San Pedro</em></a></span></p>

<p>It took nearly an hour, but eventually we got 5 minutes where the clouds broke
up enough that we could see the lake and it&#8217;s surrounding villages and actually
get an idea how high up we were.</p>

<p>On my last day at my homestay I was in a seriously bad mood. I&#8217;d been kept up
all night by bombas going off, and then I&#8217;d put in all my clothes at the laundry
and been given back half of someone else&#8217;s stuff and a bunch of my stuff was
missing, so I was hiding out in my room trying to nap. I got a knock on the door
from Gloria, telling me there&#8217;d been some kind of mix up at the school so there
was another student coming to stay that night, so I would have to share my room
with someone from their extended family for the night. With the anti-social
grumpy mood I was in, and me leaving the next day, I really didn&#8217;t feel like
having to meet anyone new. I actually kind of resented this new person for
coming into &#8220;my space&#8221; and I hadn&#8217;t even met them.</p>

<p>I continued my nap, and later when I awoke I found the new student, Rachel,
outside in the hammock of the courtyard. We talked for a bit, I found out she
was a school teacher from California, down in Guatemala for 5-6 weeks to try and
learn Spanish. She seemed really lovely and friendly and asked if I wanted to go
get dinner with her. I nearly said no, just because of bad mood I was in, but I
decided to go along anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16817190599/in/set-72157651239918317" title="Wheels of death by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8739/16817190599_bd9d79245a_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Wheels of death" class="img-responsive"><em>Wheels of death</em></a></span></p>

<p>We had a nice dinner and some drinks, talked a bunch and got along really well.
After dinner we wandered around the festivities in the street, looking at the
sketchy looking rides and amusements set up in one part of the town, and later
watched some of the live music and dancing at one of the stages. I was very glad
I&#8217;d ignored my bad mood, because I ended up having a really nice evening. Even
the massive crowds of people everywhere didn&#8217;t bother me for a chance.</p>

<p>We were both planning on going to another city called Xela in the next few
weeks, so we traded numbers so we could stay in touch and maybe meet up and hang
out again there some time. I was a bit sad that our time at the school hadn&#8217;t
overlapped, but was hopeful that we would catch up again in a few weeks. Little
did I know at that time that we would end up hanging out and travelling together
for nearly the next two months :)</p>

<p>Next stop for me was Antigua Guatemala, the original capital of Guatemala until
they got sick of all the earthquakes knocking it over every few decades. It&#8217;s a
very beautiful city, littered with ruins of majestic old ruins of buildings that the
government doesn&#8217;t have enough funds to do preservation works to, so most of them
are fenced off without so much as a plaque to say what it was.</p>

<p>My first day in Antigua, I went with an Aussie couple I met at the hostel to
explore some of the markets in the city. We went to the &#8220;real&#8221; market and a few
of the tourist ones and the differences were striking. The real markets were
busy, noisy places, each shop seems to specialise in selling only one type of
things, largely stuff I wouldn&#8217;t need but it was interesting to see and made for
some nice photos. The tourist markets on the other hand were big places with
pretty much no one in them but the shop owners, filled with hundreds of shops
all selling the same kitsch crap.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16337486063/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Egg McFuckin' Muffin &amp; Advil please by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7589/16337486063_cd6d1e023e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Egg McFuckin' Muffin &amp; Advil please" class="img-responsive"><em>Egg McFuckin&#8217; Muffin &amp; Advil please</em></a></span></p>

<p>We stopped for lunch at a place that my Aussie friends had heard was good and
they had a pretty amusing menu featuring an egg mcfuckin&#8217; muffin and free Advil!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16770116540/in/set-72157651649474182" title="How the Egg McFuckin' Muffin comes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8719/16770116540_8df599cc96_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="How the Egg McFuckin' Muffin comes" class="img-responsive"><em>How the Egg McFuckin&#8217; Muffin comes</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ordered myself the egg mcfuckin and thought it seemed like a good deal coming
with a free cocktail. I was pretty surprised when it came out and the muffin,
fries and fruit came out on skewers in the cocktail, like cocktail stirrers!</p>

<p>The next day I booked myself in for a trip up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacaya">Volcan Pacaya</a>, one of
Guatemala more active volcanoes that last seriously erupted in 2010, blowing ash
so high that it even rained down on the modern day capital Guatemala City.</p>

<p>The walk up wasn&#8217;t too challenging, there were a few steep parts with very fine
(thankfully damp) gravel-ish soil, but for the most part it was an easy walk up
a hill. There were some guys with horses that insisted on following us and
trying to coerce us into paying to ride a horse up instead, shouting &#8220;taxi&#8221; at
us over and over. Annoying on a bunch of levels, making the nature we were
surrounded by feel as obnoxious as a city street, covering the trail in horse
shit, and triggering my allergy to horses pretty severely.</p>

<p>When we got to the top, it was like looking at the surface of another planet. An
huge hill of jagged black volcanic rocks, steam vents letting out steam all
over the place.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16363276783/in/set-72157651649474182" title="The lava store/tourist trap by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8721/16363276783_cab6e6e3df_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The lava store/tourist trap" class="img-responsive"><em>The lava store/tourist trap</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was a little shop up there selling souvenirs, working under the novel
pretence of being a shop on a volcano.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16982473711/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Marshmallow taco by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7626/16982473711_9532de2492_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Marshmallow taco" class="img-responsive"><em>Marshmallow taco</em></a></span></p>

<p>However, the highlight was being able to roast marshmallows over invisible
volcanic heat vents. They were some of the tastiest roasted marshmallows I&#8217;ve
ever had; we even toasted a few tortillas and made a marshmallow taco!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16363293653/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Turns out dogs love marshmallows by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7636/16363293653_ef199282ed_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Turns out dogs love marshmallows" class="img-responsive"><em>Turns out dogs love marshmallows</em></a></span></p>

<p>We actually had a dog follow us up the hill the whole way, and found there were
a whole bunch of them at the vents where people roast marshmallows, who had
apparently developed a taste for marshmallows.</p>

<p>While in Antigua I also took advantage of some of the free salsa lessons on
offer around the city. I was absolutely terrible to start off, and didn&#8217;t
improve very quickly, but I could feel a lot of similarities in the learning
with the way I have to learn new poi moves; repetition of the basics over and
over until I no longer have to think &#8220;ok, what&#8217;s next&#8221; and can free up my mind
to concentrate on the more complicated aspects. I do wish rhythm came a bit more
naturally to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16363383863/in/set-72157651649474182" title="This part of the wall fell a long way from the rest of it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8697/16363383863_8ef0495537_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="This part of the wall fell a long way from the rest of it" class="img-responsive"><em>This part of the wall fell a long way from the rest of it</em></a></span></p>

<p>I explored a few of the more maintained ruins around the city, but the most
impressive one for me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Recolección_Architectural_Complex">Convento La Recolección</a>, an old cathedral and
monastery/convent. I&#8217;d barely entered the site and a grounds keeper approached me
and started showing me around as a bit of a tour guide, all in Spanish which was
good practice but may mean I have some mistranslations.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16797269099/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Ruined courtyard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7644/16797269099_f52a4e9fa2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ruined courtyard" class="img-responsive"><em>Ruined courtyard</em></a></span></p>

<p>The level of the soil is apparently now about 3 metres higher than it was, so
big parts are now buried. He showed me around a few of the courtyards with tons
of rooms leading off them which I think the inhabitants used to live in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16982080292/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Danger by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7622/16982080292_5d9ae698a4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Danger" class="img-responsive"><em>Danger</em></a></span></p>

<p>We then went to a little room with a big locked door with &#8220;Danger&#8221; written on it
in Spanish, that he proceeded to unlock and lead me in. Inside was a chapel, one
of the less destroyed parts of the site. I went down a little hole in the ground
down a ladder and into the catacombs where it was pitch black. There was a dark
tunnel leading off that I was told was an ancient secret passage between here
and one of the churches over in the middle of the city. Amazing! I wish I&#8217;d had
a better flashlight than my iPhone.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16361062454/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Secret garden by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7591/16361062454_84e547d8cd_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Secret garden" class="img-responsive"><em>Secret garden</em></a></span></p>

<p>The chapel was beautiful, a beautiful example of nature reclaiming man made
structures. Green moss growing over most of the surfaces, a hole in the roof
letting light stream in on top of a little garden of ferns. I really wish I&#8217;d
had a tripod to take a series of shots of varied exposures to have a go at some
proper HDR shots, but I made do with what I had and got some nice shots anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16361094544/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Epic ruinage of the monastery of the recollection by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7605/16361094544_1a0d73517c_c.jpg" width="800" height="173" alt="Epic ruinage of the monastery of the recollection" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic ruinage of the monastery of the recollection</em></a></span></p>

<p>The last part he showed me was the cathedral itself, which must have had 30-40
meter high ceilings and walls several meters thick, now largely in huge chunks
on the floor. The earthquakes must have been incredible to knock this place down
so thoroughly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16797299179/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Convent of the order of mercy fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8709/16797299179_ce3ac8ec8d_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Convent of the order of mercy fountain" class="img-responsive"><em>Convent of the order of mercy fountain</em></a></span></p>

<p>Other highlights where the massive fountain inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Merced_Church">Iglesia La Merced</a>,
27 metres across and set inside a huge courtyard.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16796052590/in/set-72157651649474182" title="Antigua Cathedral ruins by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7614/16796052590_1855a0d78c_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Antigua Cathedral ruins" class="img-responsive"><em>Antigua Cathedral ruins</em></a></span></p>

<p>And the cathedral next to central park. From the outside I didn&#8217;t even realise
it was a ruin, but inside all of the domes of the ceilings are gone and a few
other bits have collapsed, making some stunning natural skylights. I heard that
this one wasn&#8217;t actually a victim of the earthquakes, but rather collapsed
because of a lack of maintenance.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15852033030/in/set-72157649787007102" title="Waterfall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8635/15852033030_5086636e7e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterfall near Lago Yejoa" class="img-responsive"><em>Waterfall near Lago Yejoa</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a cram packed week up in the USA, I felt like I really needed a bit of a
rest, so once I got back down to Honduras I headed directly down to Lago Yejoa,
the home of the D&amp;D Brewery.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The brewery is attached to a hostel set on a little forested block of land, both
of which are run by Bobby, the late-20s American owner. He tells me he runs
the brewery as a bit of fun, and to provide some jobs for the locals. Apparently
the area wasn&#8217;t really on the tourist circuit at all back before he started up
here, and now lots of people are coming to the area specifically to visit the
brewery and then are told about the local natural attractions around to visit.</p>

<p>Bobby makes some pretty tasty beers, from memory there were maybe 5-6 different
ones on tap but I&#8217;ve neglected to keep any notes about what they were. They&#8217;re
made in a sort of large scale home brew manner, using malt extracts and hops. I
asked Bobby if he&#8217;s thought about doing it with actual grains (the all-grain
homebrewer in my past believes it&#8217;s the only way to make exception beers), and
he told me he&#8217;d originally bought a pallet of grain with the intention of doing
it all that way, but the humidity in the area makes it near impossible to store
the stuff without it spoiling and growing mould, which seems like a pretty fair
reason for doing it the way he does.</p>

<p>The place has a nice little restaurant that makes pretty good burritos and
baliadas, but their most impressive menu option is the blueberry pancakes which
have a very generous portion of fresh blueberries cooked into them. I think I
ate them for breakfast nearly every morning I was there. They&#8217;re so good I&#8217;d
probably recommend going their for the pancakes even if you don&#8217;t like beer!</p>

<p>One night I got talking with an Irish guy named Johnny who is one of the most
interesting people I&#8217;ve met on the road so far. He&#8217;s an Irish bloke who makes
his living as a travel blogger, travelling 9 months out of every year and living
in Thailand the other 3.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15852046620/in/set-72157649787007102" title="Johnny and the lake by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7516/15852046620_49658900ab_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Johnny and the lake" class="img-responsive"><em>Johnny and the lake</em></a></span></p>

<p>The guy is like one of those self made success stories you&#8217;d read about in a
magazine. He started off with a travel blog, and then worked out how to make
very decent money online through SEO marketing. He had visited 114 countries
when I met him (now 141 with the slow rate I update my blog), and plans to visit
every country in the world in the next few years. I&#8217;ll chuck in a plug for <a href="http://onestep4ward.com">his
website</a> in case you want to see for yourself.</p>

<p>It was really interesting to talk to someone who&#8217;s been on the road so long, a
whole lot more insightful than the average backpacker about the difficulties and
challenges of truly living life on the road, as opposed to just living overseas.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16038626042/in/set-72157649787007102" title="D&amp;D Brewery by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7492/16038626042_a74543b628_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="D&amp;D Brewery" class="img-responsive"><em>D&amp;D Brewery</em></a></span></p>

<p>Johnny and myself did a hike up to a nearby lookout the next morning, and we
were half way up when my flip-flops decided to tear through the toe strap,
leaving me to do the rest of the way up and the way back barefoot. The view from
the top was pretty nice and my feet held up surprisingly well, although I did
get some nasty ant bites and found it very hard coming down hill through all the
mud.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853267539/in/set-72157649787007102" title="Me and the view by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7491/15853267539_275da5e0a0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me and the view" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and the view</em></a></span></p>

<p>After nearly a week at D&amp;D I was feeling re-energised and so I got the chicken
bus to Copan via San Pedro Sula, during which I had the closest thing to a bad
experience I had in Honduras.  At one point a man got on, stood up at the front
of the bus and asked me in English where I was from. After a little bit of small
talk he switched to Spanish and started yelling something at the bus, then
started digging around in his bag for something. I thought for sure we were
being hijacked and he was about to pull out a gun, but then he actually pulled
out a bible and continued to yell at the bus for 15 minutes, before taking of
his shirt and showing that he was covered in religious (prison?) tattoos. A huge
sense of relief washed over me when I realised he was a preacher and not a
hijacker.</p>

<p>Once I&#8217;d arrived in Copan and found somewhere to stay, me and a few guys from
the hostel went to check out (probably) the only authentic German brewery in
Honduras. We&#8217;d gone there at 3pm in the afternoon to have a beer or two and get
something to eat, but ended up staying until about 11pm and drinking many beers.</p>

<p>The brewery is run by an older German guy named Thomas, who&#8217;s imported all the
shiny brewery equipment from Germany himself, and has big temperature controlled
fridges for fermenting his 120 litre batches. He imports all the German malts
himself and mostly brews adhering to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a> (German beer
purity law), although he tells me he does make a hefeweizen with cacao beans in
it which sounds like it would be delicious! Getting shown around the back room
and all the brewery bling had me reminiscing about my years as an all-grain
homebrewer throughout university.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16453437188/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Thomas who runs the only German brewery in Honduras by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8624/16453437188_e7d37d3d3c_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Thomas who runs the only German brewery in Honduras" class="img-responsive"><em>Thomas who runs the only German brewery in Honduras</em></a></span></p>

<p>The two beers on tap while I was there were a hefeweizen and a red lager. I really
enjoyed the hefe, but everyone else seemed to prefer the lager. One thing is
certain, Thomas definitely makes some of the best beer in all of Honduras!</p>

<p>The next day I headed to a place called Macaw Mountain, a private bird reserve
aiming at repopulating the Macaws in the local area. They also have a bunch of
other exotic Central American birds such as toucans, and parrots, all of which
have been donated by pet owners who no longer wanted them, or confiscated from
bird smugglers.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16018395964/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Me and a bunch of macaws by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8584/16018395964_1f82870c5e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me and a bunch of macaws" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and a bunch of macaws</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a big interactive area where you could get a photo taken with a bunch of
the Macaws; they&#8217;d perch on you and then you&#8217;d twist your wrist a little and the
birds would spread their wings for the photo!</p>

<p>They were actually keeping a whole lot of macaws at Copan Ruins to try and get
them used to the area, and then later opened their cages releasing them into the
wild, in an effort to repopulate the Macaws the feature so heavily in the
carvings there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16639283661/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Toe biting toucan.

What a little bastard" class="img-responsive"><em>Toe biting toucan. What a little bastard</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was also a very naughty toucan, for some reason missing his tail feathers,
that hopped around on the ground trying to peck at toes. I was initially running
away from him every time he hopped up to me, then I decided maybe I was being
silly and let him get me&#8230; it was quite a painful peck. Cheeky little bastard!</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t visit Copan without visiting the ruins that the place is named after,
so I headed out there the next day and grouped up with a big family (half
Americans, half Hondurans) and got a guide to show us around the site.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16639405781/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Copan main steps by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7284/16639405781_489ed94d71_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Copan main steps" class="img-responsive"><em>Copan main steps</em></a></span></p>

<p>The ruins were vertically very tall, but it really wasn&#8217;t that big of a site.
The &#8220;amazing detail&#8221; that people had been telling me about actually seemed kind
of plain, especially compared to other ruins like Angkor Wat (although now
having seen other Mayan ruins, Copan really is quite detailed compared to other
Mayan sites).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16018478584/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Copan by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8657/16018478584_eb2dd7b3bf_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Copan" class="img-responsive"><em>Copan</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s lots of work that&#8217;s been done reconstructing many of the building of
Copan. Our guide pointed our a few odd shaped hills and told us that that is how
they all were when the site was found, with tree roots tearing the structures
apart, dirt filling in the gaps and eventually just looking like a pile of
rubble. It&#8217;s actually quite incredible they&#8217;re able to figure out how to put
them back together at all.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16454733849/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Standing over Copan by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7286/16454733849_19916c22f2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Standing over Copan" class="img-responsive"><em>Standing over Copan</em></a></span></p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16433620557/in/set-72157650622765828" title="Partially restored building by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8629/16433620557_331ea701fd_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Partially restored building" class="img-responsive"><em>Partially restored building</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also found out that the biggest structures actually used the previous
buildings on the same site inside them as foundations. Modern tunnels have being
dug into the buildings to get a look at some of the enclosed previous temples.
Not exposed to the weather, there is a lot more preserved details. There were
lots of great carved statues of macaw&#8217;s faces statues in the tunnels, but it is
a shame it&#8217;s so narrow in there and they&#8217;ve fenced off a lot of it now so you
have glass between you and statues, because previous visitors couldn&#8217;t keep
their damn hands to themselves.</p>

<p>After a long day looking at ruins, I headed back to town and went back to
Thomas&#8217; brewery for a few last beers in Honduras, before I started heading into
Guatemala the next day.</p>

<p>Way back in January at <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/2014/07/01/poi-love-camp/">Poi Love Camp</a> I&#8217;d asked
Jonathan Alvarez what he thought the best flow festival was during them summer
in the USA, and he told me he thought FireDrums was number one, so I put it in
my calendar and mostly forgot about it. Much later I realised it was only a few
weeks away, and decided to impulse buy a ticket, sort out some flights and get
my self along to see it for myself.</p>

<p>I flew from San Pedro Sula (aka. Murderville) to San Francisco, with a brief
stopover in Houston, but a delayed flight meant that I was arriving at 11pm
instead of 9pm like I had intended, so it was very late by the time I left the
airport, which meant I got the royal introduction from San Francisco wackos,
from the crazy guy on BART who was laughing and ranting, telling everyone that
he wasn&#8217;t dead, and that he&#8217;d killed Elvis, to the super friendly homeless guy
on the bus who was very insistent that I had to visit Pier 39 while I&#8217;m in town
to see the real San Francisco.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16013228826/in/set-72157647472845853" title="Camille, my couchsufing host by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8576/16013228826_6e22fd4350_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Camille, my couchsufing host" class="img-responsive"><em>Camille, my couchsufing host</em></a></span></p>

<p>I was staying with some people I&#8217;d gotten in touch with through couchsurfing, a
very hospitable girl named Camille and her lovely house mate Rose. They were
awesome! They even had a little dinner party one night; I couldn&#8217;t have asked for better hosts.</p>

<p>I had a day in San Francisco to sort out things I needed for FireDrums (sleeping
bag, camp mat, food. I was lucky enough to get offered a lift and a spot in
someone&#8217;s tent which saved me a whole lot of hassle), but I started off the day
by exploring some of the mission street, one of the oldest and longest streets
in the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853224077/in/set-72157647472845853" title="Awesome alley of murals by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8593/15853224077_0a37dc5248_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Awesome alley of murals" class="img-responsive"><em>Awesome alley of murals</em></a></span></p>

<p>I found some cool little alleyways full of murals, Clarion Alley in particular.</p>

<p>During the day I ended up walking nearly the entire length of Mission street
right down to the ferry building (I switched over to Market at some point when
Mission got too seedy for me, I think it was about the time I saw a deaf woman
gesturing blowjobs at passing cars, then at me), with a quick detour to the
camping shop to pick up the stuff I needed and a quick stop in at Chez Maman, a
restaurant that pretty much everyone I know from Melbourne who&#8217;s been to San
Francisco seems to rave about.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853233307/in/set-72157647472845853" title="Super fancy burger at Chez Maman by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7478/15853233307_04a5160076_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Super fancy burger at Chez Maman" class="img-responsive"><em>Super fancy burger at Chez Maman</em></a></span></p>

<p>Chez Maman was a tiny little place, mostly just counter seating along the grill.
I got a basic burger with goats cheese, and it was pretty good, but that and a
beer came out to $25 with taxes and the tip so it was more than I would have
liked to spend just on lunch. Maybe I&#8217;d feel better about it if I still had an
income.</p>

<p>The next morning my ride to FireDrums, a friendly bloke named Peter, showed up
in his truck and we headed a few hours north to Navarro; the beautiful FireDrums
site fully of enormous redwood trees. Peter was kind enough to offer me not
just a ride, but also some space to sleep in his tent which made flying in for
the event a whole lot easier than it could have been. Thanks again mate!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16039011385/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Completed teserect by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7557/16039011385_4feca349af_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Completed teserect" class="img-responsive"><em>Completed teserect</em></a></span></p>

<p>On arrival we quickly put up Peter&#8217;s tent, then went off to work our first
volunteer shifts. As part of keeping costs down, everyone attending FireDrums is
expected to help out by doing a few volunteer shifts. I volunteered for one of
the setup shifts, which resulted in me working on putting together the stand for
the Teserect, a magical mirror filled box that belongs to Prometheatrics.
Prometheatrics happens to be the burning man camp I was lined up to camp with,
so as a bonus I got to meet a few people from the camp, TeaFaerie, Sean and
Spin, all of whom are lovely.</p>

<p>Wandering around later that afternoon I ran into Tim and Lou, two more spinners
I&#8217;d briefly met back home in Oz, who were touring around the USA hitting all the
bit flow festivals. Nice to see some familiar faces and hear some accents from
home.</p>

<p>I also bumped into Jonathan who gave me a super excited welcome as though I was
flow-famous or something. That guy is so damn friendly!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853254257/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Opening ceremony by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7519/15853254257_39bfd6bd6a_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Opening ceremony" class="img-responsive"><em>Opening ceremony</em></a></span></p>

<p>The event opened with an opening ceremony around the fire circle, led by Sky (?)
and Ben Drexler, yet another person who made a huge number of youtube tutorials
I&#8217;ve watched.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16013259326/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Timmy teaching tapedeck torrids by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7493/16013259326_296308a805_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Timmy teaching tapedeck torrids" class="img-responsive"><em>Timmy teaching tapedeck torrids</em></a></span></p>

<p>Each day of FireDrums was cram packed with workshops for all different kinds of
things, from poi to staffs, hoop to juggling, footwork to flexibility. I took
some great classes about all different kinds of poi throws and tosses which I
feel add a bit of a club juggling flair to spinning poi; classes on different
advanced stalls, Tim&#8217;s classes on iso-pendulums and tape-desk toroids, and a
bunch more. With some many workshops each day, you really had to accept you
couldn&#8217;t go to all of the ones you wanted to, and if you went to one in every
timeslot you were thoroughly burnt out with information overload for the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851750940/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Burn night one by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8602/15851750940_7343ce9717_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Burn night one" class="img-responsive"><em>Burn night one</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;d been wanting to purchase my first set of fire poi for a while, and so had
been looking around at all the market stalls and had narrowed it down to just a
few different types of wicks. After the fire circle started up the first night,
I managed to find some people with the kind I was looking at who were kind
enough to let me have a go with them lit up, so I could get a better idea of how
they differed.</p>

<p>I ended up splashing out for some twista style wicks, glow-in-the-dark soft pom
grips, and fancy new Technora fire resistant rope leashes instead of the
traditional chains, so that my fire poi and my LED poi feel a bit more similar.
I got in a good number of burns each night and have been extremely happy with
the new poi.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16037105091/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Performance night by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8639/16037105091_b2bfc14f37_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Performance night" class="img-responsive"><em>Performance night</em></a></span></p>

<p>One evening their was a showcase of performers getting up on the stage of the
amphitheatre to show off their skills. There was some fantastic partner acts and
one of the most amazing hoopers I&#8217;ve ever seen. An epic display of talent on show.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16013285546/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Burn night two by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8671/16013285546_47985ac650_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Burn night two" class="img-responsive"><em>Burn night two</em></a></span></p>

<p>My other volunteer shift was a fire safety shift, relieving a pretty girl named
Leora of her post. Being a fire safety pretty much involves sitting at the edge
of the fire circle with a blanket of fireproof material called Duvetyne,
watching people spin, keeping an out out for any clothing that catches alight
and letting the wearer know (and help them put it out if needed. My shift was
pretty trouble free, mostly just putting out peoples props who were done
spinning, although I did need to put the back of one dudes pants out that had
caught on fire.</p>

<p>I should stop and say the fire circle was pretty crazy. Never before have I seen
so many people spinning fire in one place, and so much talent. Even with all the
safeties around, it almost felt like there was too much going on for everyone to
have someone keeping an eye on them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16037109191/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Burn night two by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7540/16037109191_9b823e1b2b_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Burn night two" class="img-responsive"><em>Burn night two</em></a></span></p>

<p>I find the contrast between Australian and USA approaches to safety really
interesting. In the USA white gas is the fuel of choice, while in Australia it&#8217;s
frowned upon because it&#8217;s quite a bit more dangerous and people prefer fuels
with kerosene-like properties. Kerosene burns cooler, and it needs a wick to
burn, which means that fuel spraying off or being spilt are less dangerous (but
still not good). You can drop a lit match into a bucket of kerosene-like fuel
and it will go out. Do the same with a bucket of white gas and you have a huge
problem. Kerosene-like fuels do have the downsides that they don&#8217;t burn as
cleanly or as brightly.</p>

<p>Now the interesting part is (perhaps because of these choices in fuel), I&#8217;ve
gotten the impression that people from the USA are far more conscientious about
having a dedicated fire safety person around when people spin, with proper
equipment around to put out fires. Maybe it&#8217;s just me being unobservant, but I
feel like I&#8217;ve spun fire, or seen people spinning fire back home in oz a load of
times but I&#8217;d never been or seen a fire safety for anyone. I don&#8217;t recall seeing
Duvetyne in real life before going to the USA; at most I&#8217;ve heard of people
using wet towels. It&#8217;s funny how each country seems to have focused on
optimizing one aspect of safety, but ignores another aspect.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851788020/in/set-72157647464916314" title="Burn night two by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8631/15851788020_837b4b3c83_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Burn night two" class="img-responsive"><em>Burn night two</em></a></span></p>

<p>Anyway, after sitting in the cold, being a fire safety for 2 hours, I went out
and had another few burns with my new poi to warm up again. On my last burn of
the night, I was offered some titanium powder, a substance you can apply to your
props that makes them throw off little firefly like sparkles, especially when
they stop abruptly, like in a spiral wrap. Wanting to see sparkles, I did a
spiral wrap (perhaps too early in the burn with too much excess white gas, or
perhaps the heat from the burning titanium?), and
when the spiral unwrapped the top of my hand was on fire. I patted it out and
kept spinning until the fuel on the poi burned out, after which I noticed it was
actually quite a painful burn so I headed to first aid who gave me some
antibiotic cream and told me to expect blisters.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419500053/in/set-72157647464916314" title="My first spin related burn by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8616/15419500053_e7dd8ed50a_c.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="My first spin related burn" class="img-responsive"><em>My first spin related burn</em></a></span></p>

<p>The pain was pretty nasty, so I ended up taking some painkillers and some
sleeping tablets and went to bed just so I didn&#8217;t have to put up with it any
longer. Anyway, it&#8217;s a lesson I wont soon forget in being careless with new
fuels that I&#8217;m not familiar with; both the titanium powder and the white gas.</p>

<p>The next day we got up and packed down the tent, and Peter mentioned he&#8217;d
organized to give some chick a lift back with us to San Francisco, who turned
out to be Leora from fire safety the night before.</p>

<p>Peter was very keen to go to some hot springs on the way back called Harbin
that were &#8220;clothing optional.&#8221; I think I saw one maybe person wearing pants.
You&#8217;d be the strange one if you weren&#8217;t naked.</p>

<p>Leora seemed equally hesitant as me to strip off, but I figured YOLO and we all
stripped off and went and bathed in the springs. For the most part, me and Leora
stuck together, so it was really good to have a
&#8220;not-completely-comfortable-with-this&#8221; buddy there with me to share the
experience with. Peter on the other hand seemed completely in his element. To be
honest it was actually a lot less awkward/uncomfortable than I had imagined it
might be. When everyone is naked it doesn&#8217;t seem like such a big deal at all.</p>

<p>There was a super hot &#8220;meditation&#8221; pool, a hot &#8220;quiet&#8221; pool&#8221; a warm pool, an icy
cold pool and a big swimming pool. We went into the hot pool for a little bit,
then the super hot pool for all of about 30 seconds before it was too hot, then
the icy pool, then the warm pool again, then the swimming pool&#8230; and then back and
forth a bit more. It was a rather enjoyable way to relax for a few hours.</p>

<p>Coming back into San Francisco the bay was crazy foggy; a stark contrast from
when we left in the other direction and it was clear blue skies. You couldn&#8217;t
even see the top of the Golden Gate bridge as we drove over it.</p>

<p>We dropped Leora off at the airport then headed back to Peter&#8217;s place where he&#8217;d
been kind enough to offer me his couch for a few nights.</p>

<p>I spent the few days before my flight exploring various places around San
Francisco, some touristy, some of very little interest to most people.</p>

<p>I fan-stalked past Github HQ. I made a visit to one of the regular spin jams
that take place at the Vulcan, home to a bunch of San Francisco&#8217;s amazing poi
spinners.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419533953/in/set-72157647472845853" title="I may have spun poi in the Exploratorium to try and make pretty patterns by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7502/15419533953_1780b01109_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="I may have spun poi in the Exploratorium to try and make pretty patterns" class="img-responsive"><em>I may have spun poi in the Exploratorium to try and make pretty patterns</em></a></span></p>

<p>I even walked up the hill to Lombard st, the crookedest street in the world. I

to come back with more time up my sleeve.</p>

<p>After making a one night stay in San Pedro Sula, home of the worlds worst murder
rate, I headed over to the coast and got a ferry to Utila; one of the
Bay Islands of Honduras.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I had gone there with the idea in my head that I wanted to stop and do dive
master training, a cheap way to get in a few month of daily diving. I had
flights booked to go up to California for a fire spinning festival in 2 weeks
time, so this visit was mostly just about shopping around and seeing how the
various schools compared.</p>

<p>As soon as I got off the ferry and mentioned I was considering doing my DMT, I
had a shop offer me 2 free fun dives with them, even after I made it clear I was
shopping around. The offer remained, so I had my first shop locked in!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853183127/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Utila from the water by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7520/15853183127_77791cc3a5_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Utila from the water" class="img-responsive"><em>Utila from the water</em></a></span></p>

<p>The diving around Utila was really good. The reefs were healthy looking, some of
the walls were fantastic, the there was a good amount of aquatic life around.
Big crabs, lobsters, cowfish, drumfish (especially the juveniles), bearded
toadfish, free swimming green moray eels&#8230; plenty of cool stuff every dive.</p>

<p>During the week on Utila I ended up diving with about 5 or 6 different shops,
and got a much better idea about the things that are important to me in picking
where I want to do more training. Some had tiny boats and some had fairly big
boats. Some went to the better diving on the north side pretty much daily,
others only went 1-2 times a week. Some were so relaxed about safety that they
weren&#8217;t even doing a head count, let alone boat roll calls, when diving north
side (2 hours from the inhabited part of the island, pretty poor IMO) while
others were clearly following good procedures.</p>

<p>One night I was in a bar (ok, nearly every night&#8230; often it feels like more
people are on Utila for the parties than the diving) and I got talking with some
guys who turned out to have a set of fire poi and some kerosene, so we all
headed to the beach to spin fire. It was my first time spinning with real flames
in about a year, but it was also the first time I know of that I&#8217;ve been
videoed, so I can actually show more than just still images for a change.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com//www.youtube.com/embed/LMa0Ox5I3N4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>Looking at the video afterward, I can see a lot of places where I was falling
into pretty dull repetitive sequences, but I still think there&#8217;s some good stuff
in there. I feel like I&#8217;m a shit load better today, but then again I mostly spin
LED poi so I probably cant do everything I can do now if I was using fire poi.</p>

<p>Later that night I went along to a beach party and a couple of other spinners
where doing their thing. I asked if I could have a go and the small crowd seemed
to really like it. I had a few people come up to me randomly in the bar
afterwards and ask about it, if I was a part of the performers. Lots of
encouragement and support, pretty damn good for someone who hates being in the
spotlight, I think it helped a lot with my fears and anxieties.</p>

<p>I pretty much lived on baleadas the whole time I was on Honduras. A baleada is
basically like a big cheesy quesadilla with different fillings, like chicken and
avocado, which I would then apply liberal amounts of hot sauce to. A place on
the island called Mamma Rosa Baleada had them for just a few bucks and they were
so big they hung over the edge of the plate, so I ate there every day, sometimes
more than once.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853182307/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Inside a baleada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8634/15853182307_d98fc373a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Inside a baleada" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside a baleada</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were a few things I really didn&#8217;t like about Utila. The first of those is
the sand flies. The bastards are everywhere and insect repellent doesn&#8217;t work for
them. One day just before (or maybe just after) rain, they were super intense.
Horrible itchy bites all up my legs :( Some people claim that baby oil on your
legs will stop them because they cant land or drown in it or something, but I
tried it and it didn&#8217;t seem to do anything. Maybe I needed to shave my legs to
make it work. Way worse than mosquitos.</p>

<p>The second pet peeve was the motorbikes and taxis that are ruining Utila. For a
tiny little 1 road strip, there&#8217;s a horrible amount of traffic constantly
zipping past, just barely missing people. They nearly always seemed to be full
of lazy locals, which makes a nice change from seeing them full of lazy
tourists.</p>

<p>In the end my pick of the dive shops for Utila would be Utila Dive Centre, they
ran a very professional environment with quality gear, they have a number of
boats of different sizes and I just got a good vibe from them. Of course I wasn&#8217;t
ready to commit to anything without having also checked out Utila&#8217;s neighbouring
island, Roatan.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851500988/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Roatan looking stormy by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7567/15851500988_46d02430fb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Roatan looking stormy" class="img-responsive"><em>Roatan looking stormy</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a week of changing dive shops every day, and not really feeling like I was
making much of a connection with many of the people I was diving with, I decided
in Roatan I was more interested in just checking out the various dive sites and
deciding if the diving was better there or on Utila, so when I arrived I picked
a shop and I stuck with them the whole week I stayed.</p>

<p>I stayed the first two nights on the island with two girls I met on the ferry
over, Nev and Tandea, since the price of a room for 3 was the same as dorms, and
the three of us went with Reef Gliders, the dive shop that offered a discount on
the accommodation where were were staying.</p>

<p>Most of the week I was diving with the same divemaster, a guy named Mickey from
South Africa who&#8217;d come to the island a decade or so ago, just for a week, but
never left. Mickey is a guy who never dives without his camera, and I later
found out that one of the Caribbean reef life photo books that you find in
nearly every dive shop in along the Caribbean Coast is actually entirely by him.
You could not get a better DM to dive with for fish ID!</p>

<p>The diving was good at Utila, but it was amazing on Roatan. I can tell you for
certain, all those backpackers making claims about how there&#8217;s no point going to
Roatan over Utila and that it&#8217;s just for rich tourists, are just regurgitating
what others have told them because a) the diving is both a lot better and a lot
lazier (longest boat ride was 10-15 minutes from the dock) and b) the prices are
actually very similar to Utila. I think over the course of 10 dives it was less
than $50 difference, although restaurants were admittedly more expensive (street
food was cheap though!).</p>

<p>My favourite dive was at a site called Texas. It&#8217;s a site off the tip of the
island which almost always has a lot of current, although there was apparently
abnormally little the day I got to dive it so apparently there was less marine
life activity than usual but it was still amazing. Since there&#8217;s current you do
the dive as a drift dive, where you get in at one place and let the current take
you while the boat follows on the surface; it makes for extremely lazy diving.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419306323/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Barracuda by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7545/15419306323_dde483b5e9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Barracuda" class="img-responsive"><em>Barracuda</em></a></span></p>

<p>The site gets it&#8217;s name, because like the state, everything is bigger at Texas.
The reef you&#8217;re drifting above is massive, trailing off for hundreds of meters
in every direction, one direction sloping down until you couldn&#8217;t see anything
but blue. We dropped down to about 25 metres, probably 2-3 metres above the
reef, and floated along at a nice lazy pace for the duration of the dive,
eventually popping up on the surface what must have been at least a kilometre
from where we started.</p>

<p>During the dive we saw loads of big stuff. Probably a dozen or more really big
groupers, some turtles who cruised along with us for a while, a number of squid,
and easily the biggest lionfish I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419297383/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Floating around by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8617/15419297383_491ae12e21_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Floating around Jesus" class="img-responsive"><em>Floating around Jesus</em></a></span></p>

<p>We also made a stop to check out &#8220;Jesus&#8221;, one of the many massive barrel sponges
down there. I&#8217;m told that some of them are thousands of years old, and Jesus is
one of the biggest ones. It&#8217;s opening would probably be about the size of your
average household washing machine, the thing was enormous! Sadly, we found that
a big chunk from the top of the sponge had very freshly been sliced by a
fisherman&#8217;s line. It wont kill it, but it&#8217;s a shame that something thousands of
years old can get damaged like that.</p>

<p>Another notably unique dive was a site called the bear&#8217;s den, when you go down a
dark tunnel into a rock (with a flashlight) which opens up into a cave with a
&#8220;skylight&#8221;, big enough to have 5 divers in there at once. It really was the sort
of cave you&#8217;d imagine a bear would live in, except it was some 25-30M underwater.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16038957555/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Scorpion fish I spotted.

Really" class="img-responsive"><em>Scorpion fish I spotted. Really</em></a></span></p>

<p>Loads of the dives were walls of coral, dropping down well below the depths you
can go down to on scuba, many with big canyons and swim-throughs zig-zagging
back and forth, but one of the coolest ones was at Haller deep. There we dropped
down to 41M where the wall went from a slope to a near vertical drop, and you
can see nothing but dark blue below you. We saw a pretty sweet turtle down there
with a shark sucker cleaning him.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851678960/in/set-72157649802065395" title="Turtle and a shark sucker by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7535/15851678960_5d59acd3ae_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Turtle and a shark sucker" class="img-responsive"><em>Turtle and a shark sucker</em></a></span></p>

<p>We came up from down there slowly, through a number of long tight swimthroughs,
following the reef back towards the island where we saw pipefish, a pipehorse,
scorpion fish and a few green eels.eventually we passed through a shallow part
of the reef with a max depth of 3M before dropping back down to about 5M to
another bit of reef where we had a bunch of snorkellers above us and we saw
flounder, yellow line arrow crabs and razor fish. Total bottom time was 63
minutes, pretty amazing to have a dive where we had stuff to look at at both 41M
and 3M, and be down there so long.</p>

<p>By the end of my time on the island, I was pretty sure I would want to do my DMT on
Roatan over Utila, but actually less certain that I wanted to sign up for it
right away. I decided to put it off until at least after Burning Man, and until
I&#8217;d seen the reefs in Belize and Cozumel, just in case they were even better
again.</p>

<p>After I was done hiding out in Esteli over easter, trying to avoid the masses of
locals who apparently usually head to the coasts and cause a ruckus, I booked a
flight from Managua to Big Corn Island. This was the most last minute flight
I&#8217;ve booked thus far, less than 24 hours before the time of the flight, although
it made no difference at all to the cost. Hooray for fixed price flights!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I played the &#8220;put everything heavy on my person and as much as possible in my
carry-on&#8221; game to make sure I beat the 15kg luggage limit. It turned out that at
the airport they actually get you to hop on the scale with your carry-on
(passenger weight actually matters on such small planes), but I felt pretty safe
that me and my bags would probably still weight less than some of the obese
people I&#8217;d seen on buses.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15797453391/in/set-72157646984886813" title="The Planes to Big Corn by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7486/15797453391_31ff4f83ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The Planes to Big Corn" class="img-responsive"><em>The Planes to Big Corn</em></a></span></p>

<p>Knowing it was a small plane, I was very surprised by the number of people at
the airport, the waiting area was packed! It turns out they run multiple planes
along the route for each scheduled flight. That day it was two little single
propeller 12 seaters and one bigger plane. I got put in one of the 12 seaters,
and scored a seat directly behind the pilot.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614166357/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Right behind the pilot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7545/15614166357_1a4ae860d3_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Right behind the pilot" class="img-responsive"><em>Right behind the pilot</em></a></span></p>

<p>We flew quite low for most of the flight giving nice views of the country,
maxing out at 9500 feet (I could read the dials from where I was sitting).
Looking down from a tiny little plane like that makes flying feel wondrous, like
it really should.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15797481511/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Murkey brown beaches. yuk by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/8414/15797481511_d59e9dec9e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Murkey brown beaches. yuk" class="img-responsive"><em>Murkey brown beaches. yuk</em></a></span></p>

<p>As we were flying over the last of the mainland, the terrain below us was very
swampy and wet, and the Caribbean sea close to shore was all brown and murky
looking for about half a kilometre before it turned into a nice blue like on the
post cards.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15800937592/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Coming in to land by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5615/15800937592_8b60c1568c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Coming in to land" class="img-responsive"><em>Coming in to land</em></a></span></p>

<p>On landing I was impressed and surprised by just how quickly the plane came to a
halt. I wonder how long the tyres on one of these little planes last, braking
like that?</p>

<p>Collecting luggage was a disorganised mess. Three planes full of people crammed
into a 4M x 4M room, with guys bringing the bags in a few at a time, and
checking your baggage tags matched. Mine thankfully came up quite early on, some
people had to wait for a fourth plane to come with their luggage.</p>

<p>From the Big Corn Island airport, I shared a cab to the dock where I caught a
ferry to the place I actually wanted to be, Little Corn Island. The seas were a
lot rougher than they had looked from the air, but a seasickness pill kept me
feeling fine for the duration of the journey.</p>

<p>The evening I arrived on Little Corn the power was out. The island normally only
has power for a few hours a day, but something had gone wrong with the island&#8217;s
generator, so the only places with power were the fancier hotels that had their
own generators. This made for a fun time getting my bearings, wandering out in
the dark, trying to follow path ways and find somewhere to have dinner.
Eventually I gave up and went to the restaurant attached to one of the fancy
hotels.</p>

<p>I stayed the first few nights in a place near the pier called Three Brothers,
but that side of the island doesn&#8217;t get much wind so the place I was in was
stinking hot, and inland enough that you don&#8217;t get the whole island vibe. After
a few nights there I moved over to a little cabin on the beach at Elsa&#8217;s place
over the other side of the island for pretty much the same price, where I could
see the water from my door, and stepped out my door right onto the sand.
Constant cool sea breezes, a much nicer location!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15775878106/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Conch shell art by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7498/15775878106_65d6c5b1d1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Conch shell art at Elsa's place" class="img-responsive"><em>Conch shell art at Elsa&#8217;s place</em></a></span></p>

<p>That said, the staff at Elsa&#8217;s place were some of the least friendly people I&#8217;ve
ever met, and there was some stuff about the place that was just plain weird.</p>

<p>There were two towels in my room for me to use (a nice unexpected bonus), but
there was no toilet paper in the shared toilets for pretty much the whole time I
was there. I ended up stashing my own roll in my room, but I have to wonder what
they&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>Every time I went to the reception to do anything I seemed to get dirty looks
from the hoard of staff sitting around, and they all continue sitting around and
scream to some woman from out the back to come and serve. I would see them being
nice among themselves, laughing and smiling, but as soon as a tourist was
involved they&#8217;d instantly swap those smiles for scowls and behave like you had
insulted their mothers or something. Even when I went to pay for my stay there,
the grumpy woman barely did more than grunt at me. Too lazy to get up off her
fat arse when I went to the counter, and then she acted very put out when she
had to stand up to collect $105 I owed; a lot of money in Nicaragua. I struggle
to believe it&#8217;s just a cultural thing, the family running this place really just
seem to hate the very people they rely on for income.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614640840/in/set-72157646984886813" title="The path to my beach hotel by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5609/15614640840_916536c448_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="The path to my beach hotel" class="img-responsive"><em>The path to my beach hotel</em></a></span></p>

<p>I asked if I could use the laundry sink I&#8217;d seen near my room. No. I asked if
they had a laundry service. No. I asked if they could tell me somewhere I could
go to get my laundry done. No. Ok, screw you then. I&#8217;m going to take stupidly
long showers wearing my dirty clothes to wash them in there then. Backpacking
life.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time spinning poi while I was on the island. Nearly every day
I&#8217;d find somewhere nice and shady and put on an album and just play around
practicing different things until the album stopped. Some days I&#8217;d do a second
album back to back. I was trying to focus on doing things slowly and with more
control, and I found the Amelie soundtrack as nearly perfect for that, with
Opiuo&#8217;s Meraki thrown in for something a bit more upbeat now and then.
Definitely saw some good improvement during the time I was there.</p>

<p>The diving on Little Corn, the whole reason I was there, was fantastic. Lots and
lots of big marine life. I think I saw at least one nurse shark on every single
dive, often more. One dive we had a small one follow us around the entire dive
like a cute little puppy dog. Most dives I&#8217;d also spot loads of southern
stingrays, lobsters, juvenile angel fish, baby drumfish, spotted trunkfish,
trumpet fish, Atlantic spadefish, blue tangs, scorpionfish, groupers and creole
wrasse. The reef seemed to very quite healthy, with some of the more colourful
coral I&#8217;d ever seen. Lots of purples tubes and greens fans for a change.</p>

<p>After being buddied up with noobie photographers far too many times I&#8217;ve
developed my own set of rules for buddy&#8217;s on recreational dives, which goes
against everything PADI teaches, but PADIs buddy rules were made before every
other fuckwit with 4 dives under their belt bought a GoPro so I don&#8217;t think
they&#8217;re a good fit for random pairings.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you have a problem, the nearest person is your buddy.</li>
  <li>Likewise, Always help someone who needs it.</li>
  <li>Never go to far from the nearest diver that you don&#8217;t think you could make it
back again without another breath of air.</li>
  <li>Conversely, give me some space and don&#8217;t dive right on top of me. Anyone
should be able to hold their breath for 20-30 seconds, or maybe they should
reconsider getting the in the water.</li>
  <li>Be responsible for yourself.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the (unspoken) rules I stick to when buddied up with someone I&#8217;ve never
met before.  Sorry if that makes me a dick, but I don&#8217;t know what sort of a
diver you are so I&#8217;m expecting the worst.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to follow you around while you scare sea-life sticking your GoPro
in their frightened faces. If something goes wrong and I need air, I&#8217;m not
wasting time trying to figuring out who and where you are; I&#8217;m going to get air
wherever it&#8217;s available, the nearest person. Then, once the high-stress incident
is over, I can find my &#8220;buddy&#8221;, or more likely the DM for advice on what step to
take next; most likely to abort the dive.</p>

<p>Forget PADI/SSI&#8217;s buddy system when you&#8217;re diving with holiday divers you&#8217;ve never
even met before, it&#8217;s just not safe or realistic. Rant over</p>

<p>One new thing I&#8217;d never seen before now is the spearing of lionfish to protect
the reefs in the Carribean. Lionfish are actually a species from Asia that have
accidentally been introduced here, that have very few real predators while they
eat the juvenile offspring of the fish native to here. And thus, pretty much
every dive guide will carry a spear with them and spear any lionfish they see,
often then feeding them to a passing nurse shark.</p>

<p>This has had the interesting effect on nurse shark behavior that they will now
follow groups of divers around during dives, hoping to get an easy meal.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how others seem giddy to be killing something and
feeding it to sharks or the lobsters. I actually kind of feel sorry for them. We
are pretty much all &#8220;introduced&#8221; humans. We&#8217;ve done bad things to the
environment, and wiped out entire species. Imagine if we were targeted for
elimination as pests/danger to the place we lived.</p>

<p>I got the chance to go out on just one night dive, but I got to see almost
everything you could hope to see on a night dive. A mushroom scorpion fish, 7+
southern stingrays, a friendly little remora who snuck up on the sand next to us
while we had lights out to check the bioluminescence and then stayed there
watching when we turned them our lights back on, a toadfish. I spotted a
Caribbean reef octopus amongst some seaweed with nowhere to hide, it was awesome
to see him changing colours, through yellow, blue and green trying hopelessly to
hide. We saw 2-3 green turtles and a giant big loggerhead as well, some peacock
flounders hiding on the sand, a reef squid , some nudibranch, lots of lobsters
and hundreds of shrimp. You could spot the shrimp from quite a distance as their
eyes reflect the torchlight back as little pink dots on the coral and rocks.
Some were quite big, and really fast moving. As is often the case, the night
dive was easily my favourite.</p>

<p>(Sorry about how text heavy this is. Feel free to gift me an underwater camera
and I promise my diving posts will be way more interesting!)</p>

<p>One afternoon I walked almost the entire way around the island, along the beach
past all the fancy hotels that I could never afford to stay at, to lots of
beautiful stretches with nothing built along them, just natural as they should
be and lined with coconut forrest.  Eventually I got to a point where it was
just pretty much vertical cliffs with waves crashing against them, so I went up
a part that wasnt completely straight up, and ventured along random goat tracks
in the forest until I found the village.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15775872256/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Scorched earth by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7574/15775872256_8cf92c9c85_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Scorched earth" class="img-responsive"><em>Scorched earth</em></a></span></p>

<p>I was half expecting to stumble across some secret hideout for Columbian drug
smugglers, but all I found was a big chunk of forest that had recently had a big
fire. No idea how they would have managed to put it out, they may have just had
to let it burn out.</p>

<p>Guessing how long I would want to be on Little Corn Island up front (by booking
my flight as a return) meant there were a few days after I was done diving where I
didn&#8217;t have very much to do; not always a bad thing. I got in lots of reading,
resting and practicing poi.  But I was definitely looking forward to getting off
the island towards the end. Not having internet was making it very hard to work
out what I would be doing once I was back on the mainland.</p>

<h1 id="visa-run">Visa Run</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15613751839/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Middle of the runway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5614/15613751839_0882408d78_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Middle of the runway" class="img-responsive"><em>Middle of the runway</em></a></span></p>

<p>After Little Corn, I got the ferry back to Big corn and spent the night there
before my flight the next morning. I walked from where I was staying to the
airport terminal via a shortcut directly across the runway tarmac!</p>

<p>This flight I was put on a bigger place, which flew via Blue Fields. This was
much less exciting than flying in the small plane.</p>

<p>Still not having committed to what I wanted to do when I arrived, I decided
mid-flight that when I landed I was going to head straight for the Costa Rican
border to do a visa run. Having spent nearly 3 months in Nicaragua, My CA-4 visa
that was supposed to cover Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was
nearly expired and I hadn&#8217;t even made it to two of them yet.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15179633054/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Chicken bus by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5613/15179633054_a95bd56d5a_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Chicken bus" class="img-responsive"><em>Chicken bus</em></a></span></p>

<p>As is always the case, the taxi from the airport to the bus station cost more
than the buses from there, half way across the country to the border and into
Costa Rica. I&#8217;d heard bad things about this border crossing taking hours on
occasion, but again I managed to get through in under 30 minutes. Maybe I&#8217;m
lucky, or maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m doing things on the local buses instead of with
a bus full of other foreigners clogging things up. I dunno.</p>

<p>A had to wait out 72 hours in Liberia and I didn&#8217;t really do much beyond
reading, working through my Spanish workbook and sorting photos. Coming back
from Nicaragua, I was sort of blown away by just how expensive Costa Rica
seemed. Last time coming from the UK it had seemed cheap!</p>

<p>Crossing back into Nicaragua didn&#8217;t go quite as smoothly. I found out that Costa
Rica had started charging an departure tax since the last time I did this
crossing, and I found out the only place you could pay it was, not at the border
where you&#8217;d like, but half a kilometre back into Costa Rica at a shitty little
office. It&#8217;s a $7 tax, plus an unavoidable $2 &#8220;service charge&#8221; and it took them
half an hour to do whatever it is they&#8217;re doing. They do accept
their own currency, but the rate they offer is terrible.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why countries do stupid stuff like this. It just means
you leave their country on a sour note. It&#8217;s going to be the most recent thing
in your memory associated with the country. Not the nice time you had at the
beach, but how they made you walk a kilometre in the hot sun with heavy bags,
and then made you stand around and wait to pay a stupid tax. I&#8217;d rather have bribed a
border guard $10 and not have to mess around with this nonsense, but I&#8217;m not
that ballsy.</p>

<h1 id="leon">Leon</h1>

<p>My original plan was to try and make it as close to the Honduran border as I
could in a day, so I could try and do the run up to San Pedro Sula the following
day, but as luck would have it a bad childhood tooth filling that regularly
seems to cause me troubles started to feel like it was coming loose, and having
heard that Nicaragua was America&#8217;s equivalent to Thailand for dental work, I
figured I would stop and get it looked at.</p>

<p>I made it to Leon by about 5pm, found a hostel and then got them to recommend a
dentist, and by 6:30 I was in the dentist chair getting two old fillings that
she identified as bad drilled out. Amazing how quickly it all went down.</p>

<p>Oddly enough she started with no anaesthetic at all until I asked for some when
she was getting near the nerve. I expected maybe this was a cost thing and I&#8217;d
have to pay more for the anaesthetic, but that didn&#8217;t seem to be the case.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the dentist didn&#8217;t have time to do the replacement fillings the
same day, so she put in a temporary one for me for the night.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614829080/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Leon Cathedral by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7574/15614829080_e57a1085d5_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Leon Cathedral" class="img-responsive"><em>Leon Cathedral</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went back the next day and got the two fillings replaced properly, one in the
morning and one in the afternoon. She said the ones I had were terrible, which I
thought so myself. Apparently there&#8217;s some sort of laboratory filling you can
get that the dentist thinks I should look into in the next few years. I was a
bit unclear on some of that, since she only spoke Spanish and these aren&#8217;t the
kind of words you learn at language school.</p>

<p>The dental work seemed great for the money (less than $100), although I now have
a gap between those two teeth that never used to be there, which gets food stuck
in it anytime I eat, which is super annoying. I&#8217;ve never really worried about
flossing since my teeth are all so close together that stuff never really gets
between them, but now I need to do that one gap every time I eat :/</p>

<p>While I was in Leon I tried to book a tour up to Volcan Telicia, one of the
Volcanoes where you can actually see glowing lava, but apparently I was the only
person who signed up so it didn&#8217;t go ahead. Disappointed. Some day I&#8217;ll see lava
glowing.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15799583825/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Flor de Ca&#xF1;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7541/15799583825_0eef790935_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Flor de Ca&#xF1;a" class="img-responsive"><em>Flor de Ca&#xF1;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>Instead I took myself out to the Flor de Caña factory to do a tour of that. For
those who know, Flor de Caña is a rum made in Nicaragua, and it&#8217;s really damn
tasty stuff. I&#8217;d never really drunk much rum before coming to Nicaragua, but I
drank a lot of it while I was there and learned an appreciation for the good
stuff, straight up.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15614818680/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Molasses Vats by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7485/15614818680_85e5723845_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Molasses Vats" class="img-responsive"><em>Molasses Vats</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was a pretty cosy tour, just me and two American brothers. We drove past the
giant vats of molasses, each holding 1,000,000 litres of molasses. I couldn&#8217;t
help but imagine the thought of a vat failure, and molasses running everywhere
very slowly.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of interesting stuff about rum on the tour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was told that white rum loses it&#8217;s colour due to the filtration process they
use.</li>
  <li>They claim they just put alcohol in the barrels, not rum. Then being in the
barrels is what makes it into rum.</li>
  <li>6% of the barrel volume is lost to evaporation every year, meaning that to end
up with a decent volume of aged rum, you need to start with a whole lot more.</li>
  <li>25 years is the oldest rum that they make, which is also the age of a barrel
that needs replacing and around about the time the civil issues in Nicaragua
were settling down.</li>
  <li>The barrels are bought from American whiskey companies, I saw both Jim Beam
and Wild Turkey labels. The barrels are all stripped down and rebuilt before
use.</li>
  <li>They make some big environmental claims, claiming they use 100% renewable
energy from burning sugar cane husk, do an epic amount of recycling, lots more
I don&#8217;t remember now. Seems to be at odds with the views I&#8217;d heard previously
about how evil they were and are killing their workers.</li>
</ul>

<p>We did a tasting of the 18 year old rum in this beautiful room that used to be a
cellar, with furniture made from the wood of old rum barrels. It was really
pretty but they wouldn&#8217;t allow photos down there :( I&#8217;ll never understand why
that&#8217;s a thing.  They showed us how the 18 year old has no remaining sugars, by
getting us to put a little bit in the palm of our hands and rub it dry, showing
that it really doesn&#8217;t leave any sticky residue.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15799662315/in/set-72157646984886813" title="Tiny tour group by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5605/15799662315_e615a4b10a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Tiny tour group" class="img-responsive"><em>Tiny tour group</em></a></span></p>

<p>Later at the end of the tour we got to try the 7 year old with soda, but I&#8217;d
already drank plenty of that. What I really wanted was to try the 25 year old,
even if I had to buy a nip of it, but it was only on offer by the bottle for
$161. Just a wee bit out of my budget. For reference, in Nicaragua the 7 year
old can be found for $7-9, the 18 year old is about $40. There really is a huge
jump in price for those last 7 years of aging!</p>

<p>And that finally wraps up Nicaragua!</p>

<p>After leaving La Mariposa, I headed to the island of Ometepe and met up with
some friends from La Mariposa who were staying at an old farm house called Finca
Magdelena. It was just $6 a night for a private room, and they made amazing
French toast that I had for breakfast most days.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Mostly I just relaxed, caught up on reading, and worked through some of  my
Spanish workbook. Occasionally I even left the farm!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15452118857/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Ojo de agua by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3956/15452118857_80083c1b67_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ojo de agua" class="img-responsive"><em>Ojo de agua</em></a></span></p>

<p>One day we made a trip to Ojo de Agua (Eye of the water), a beautiful green
freshwater pool build over the source of a naturally occurring mineral stream.
Lovely clear water, probably 50M long and deep enough to really swim laps. I
could open my eyes underwater and see quite clearly, no stinging at all. The
pool combined with a few &#8220;coco locos&#8221; was an enjoyable way to spend the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15018262093/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Getting smashed by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3941/15018262093_ddc8430f6b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Getting smashed by the waterfall" class="img-responsive"><em>Getting smashed by the waterfall</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day, Andrei, Morgan and myself went for a hike to see a waterfall with
some local guides. It was a reasonably long walk up the hill to what turned out
to be a small but refreshing waterfall.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15017671414/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Our guides and their noisey car speaker by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3941/15017671414_133331e863_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Our guides and their noisey car speaker" class="img-responsive"><em>Our guides and their noisey car speaker</em></a></span></p>

<p>One guide had one of the toy car speakers that every Nicaraguan seems to own.
Turning it on plays a loud engine revving sound and a horn honking, and then
starts blaring the owners taste in music through a tinny speaker with massive
levels of distortion. Really painful to listen to, and he kept turning it on at
really inappropriate times too; oh look there&#8217;s a nice bird, I bet he wants to
hear the shitty car make some noise, oh no, he&#8217;s flown off. I was silently
thrilled when the batteries died. Good riddance.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15639281572/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Stilling moonshine by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3947/15639281572_e79957326c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Stilling moonshine" class="img-responsive"><em>Stilling moonshine</em></a></span></p>

<p>On the walk back down we stopped in at a little house with an illegal still
making moonshine. Andrei got a drink bottle full of the stuff, but my goodness
did it taste awful!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15459758699/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Looking out from half way up Maderas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3949/15459758699_cb68988ba5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Looking out from half way up Maderas" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking out from half way up Maderas</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day I hiked halfway up Volcan Maderas to the lookout, a nice view of
Volcan Concepción. I left at 11, back down by 1:45-2, which seemed like pretty
good time, I&#8217;d heard 2 hours each way. the last few hundreds metres before the
lookout to Concepción was really tough; super slippery and wet. Not super muddy
by that point, but I could already tell my shoes wouldn&#8217;t be up to the whole
climb. I&#8217;m ok with that since everyone I spoke to who had gone to the top said:
a) it was bullshit hard for the second half of the climb and worse for the
decent, and b) there was no view at the top. Half way was plenty for me!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15622780706/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Melinda up at tree by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5605/15622780706_80e62e9251_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Melinda up at tree" class="img-responsive"><em>Melinda up at tree</em></a></span></p>

<p>After a while I started to feel like I had gotten stuck on the island. When a
nice girl named Melinda who I met at the farm was leaving, I decided to go and
travel with her for a few days. If not for her, I might still be on Ometepe
today.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15647332352/in/set-72157648995463971" title="The ugly ass cross on the hill at Jinotega by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5604/15647332352_9fdf2081c6_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The ugly ass cross on the hill at Jinotega" class="img-responsive"><em>The ugly ass cross on the hill at Jinotega</em></a></span></p>

<p>We headed up into the hills of Jinotega, home of this gaudy cross, decked
out with spectacular florescent tubes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15018150423/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Chicken bus fun with Morgan and Andrei by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5616/15018150423_f6ac26ae92_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chicken bus fun with Morgan and Andrei" class="img-responsive"><em>Chicken bus fun with Morgan and Andrei</em></a></span></p>

<p>Travelling around Nicaragua, I just about entirely got places using the chicken
buses. these are the old USA school buses, often pimped out with fancy paint
jobs and blinking lights. I was really impressed by their frequency, I don&#8217;t
think I ever had to wait more than an hour for one, even without ever checking a
timetable. I managed to cover some fairly large distances in a day without much
planning. Luggage would go up on the roof most of the time, sometimes with
people bringing all sorts of strange things to go up there. One time that stands
out in my memory, we stopped somewhere and some guys were loading ceramic pots
and vases onto the bus roof, actually throwing them up one at a time to someone
on the roof. I was waiting for someone to miss catching one but they seem like
they do this sort of thing all the time.</p>

<p>Melinda had to go to El Salvador to get her flight home, so I met up with some
new people and we headed over to Somoto to go and check out Somoto Canyon. I&#8217;d
never been canyoning before, and it turns out that it&#8217;s awesome fun!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15646709545/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Hiking into Somoto Canyon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5609/15646709545_455161bf3d_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hiking into Somoto Canyon" class="img-responsive"><em>Hiking into Somoto Canyon</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the canyon there&#8217;s an unofficial guide office right on the highway where
loads of people hassle you, but we went further down the path and found the real
place, where the money is actually shared among the all the guides and a portion
goes to support the local community. We got a guide named Ramone and his uncle Trino, both of whom were really nice.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15460084789/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Somoto Canyon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7526/15460084789_befd8f6ac7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Somoto Canyon" class="img-responsive"><em>Somoto Canyon</em></a></span></p>

<p>The hike into the canyon was about 1km of walking in the hot sun before we got
wet for the first time. The cool water of the river flowing through the canyon
was super refreshing.  Initially we were just wading through ankle deep water,
but soon enough it got deeper and we were waist deep, and then not much later is
was too deep to touch and we were swimming down the canyon.</p>

<p>During the day we alternated between rock hopping, hiking, swimming, and
climbing over precariously steep rock faces.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15026603033/in/set-72157648995463971" title="First jump by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7519/15026603033_6bbc1d97b9_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="First jump" class="img-responsive"><em>First jump</em></a></span></p>

<p>We jumped off 3 rocks into the water below throughout the day. The first was
probably 4-5 meters, and my feet hit the bottom pretty firmly. Glad I wasn&#8217;t
stupid enough to dive!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15461202130/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Still falling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7464/15461202130_538b51639f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Still falling" class="img-responsive"><em>Still falling</em></a></span></p>

<p>The Second place was in a deeper part of the canyon, maybe a 6-8 M drip and it
seemed like a huge jump at the time.  It was a difficult scramble to get back up
from the lower pool to the rock again, but it was fun so we jumped off this one
twice.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15026678733/in/set-72157648995463971" title="The high jump by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7524/15026678733_f8eb3d11c3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The high jump" class="img-responsive"><em>The high jump</em></a></span></p>

<p>The third and final place was 20 M further along the canyon, a big 10 M drop. The
jump itself wasn&#8217;t too bad, I had a little fear before I jumped but it was fine
once I was in the air.  The terrifying part was the climb up to get to the spot
to jump from. It involved climbing up a pretty shear rock face without great
foot or hand holds, wearing shoes. It was quite challenging to not slip and fall
and hurt ourselves. Compared to the climb, jumping was easy.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15460921427/in/set-72157648995463971" title="The end of the canyon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7522/15460921427_d2ba31baa8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The end of the canyon" class="img-responsive"><em>The end of the canyon</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the canyon we saw lots of groups of Nicaraguans on the short tour
(we&#8217;d opted for the long one because you get to see a lot more of the canyon.
Apparently not many locals do the medium or long tour because they can&#8217;t swim.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15460782828/in/set-72157648995463971" title="Paddle boats by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5604/15460782828_14e827449f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Paddle boats" class="img-responsive"><em>Paddle boats</em></a></span></p>

<p>For the last little part of the canyon, we loaded 15 people into a tiny little
boat, to get us past the last long bit of river. With that many people in the
boat it was barely above water. Not sure how it would have ended with a bunch of
people who cant swim if anything had happened.</p>

<p>While studying at La Mariposa I got to take advantage of a lot of free
excursions to cool places around Nicaragua. Here&#8217;s a few of my favourites from
the month there.</p>

<h1 id="granada">Granada</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15471831282/in/set-72157648514224155" title="So many senseless deaths by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2950/15471831282_1eabd319ee_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So many senseless deaths" class="img-responsive"><em>So many senseless deaths</em></a></span></p>

<p>First stop for the day was the cemetery, where we saw the graves of a huge
number of young people who had died in the contra war. It was really sad to
think of how many young men never lived to see 20, fighting in that war. We
learnt that &#8220;burial&#8221; plots (most of which are actually chambers above ground)
are rented out, and when the family of the deceased can&#8217;t afford to pay anymore,
the body gets moved out so another one can take it&#8217;s place.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15285634408/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Cigar rolling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5600/15285634408_4d15948939_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Cigar rolling" class="img-responsive"><em>Cigar rolling</em></a></span></p>

<p>We made a visit to a cigar factory and saw how the cigars are made, using 5
kinds of leaves and a press. It was quite impressive to see how quickly they
could roll one up, then finish it off in the press.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15472286615/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Smoking a cigar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2948/15472286615_01a421445d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Smoking a cigar" class="img-responsive"><em>Smoking a cigar</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the big fat cigars and one of the thin ones were passed around for the
group to try. I thought the thin one was much nicer, but both left a terrible
stale smoke taste in my mouth.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15285398819/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Me and a McCaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5607/15285398819_9659d2fe33_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me and a McCaw" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and a McCaw</em></a></span></p>

<p>The cigar factory was also home to a huge scarlet macaw who was quite tame.
Andrei took this great photo with him on my shoulder.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15472351685/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Colonial houses by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2950/15472351685_2741f89c77_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Colonial houses in front of a volcano" class="img-responsive"><em>Colonial houses in front of a volcano</em></a></span></p>

<p>We climbed up the bell tower of the old cathedral to look out over the city.
It gave a nice view of  one of the volcanoes, and allowed you to see all the
colonial style court yards in many of the old houses.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15472204492/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Boat tour by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3932/15472204492_03a53984a7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Boat tour" class="img-responsive"><em>Boat tour</em></a></span></p>

<p>After lunch we took a boat ride out among the 365 islands surrounding Granada in
Largo Nicaragua. Some of them are tiny, while others are fairly sizable. There
were many, many houses out there, some very fancy holiday homes among them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15449400236/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Monkeys! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3929/15449400236_54fd53d0a4_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Monkeys!" class="img-responsive"><em>Monkeys!</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the islands is dubbed &#8220;monkey island&#8221;. It is home to a number of
rehabilitated monkeys, apparently put there by a vet. There were 3 spider monkeys
and a white faced one. The way the spider monkeys move is just like in the
cartoons, using their tail as if it were just a 5th arm. Apparently the monkeys
get fed regularly by the vet as the island does not grow food they eat. The
spider monkeys are quite curious and they all come out on the outer branches of
the trees and look at passing boats.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15285803010/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Swimming in the lake by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5597/15285803010_bd39b5d664_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Swimming in the lake" class="img-responsive"><em>Swimming in the lake</em></a></span></p>

<p>We stopped at a bar on one of the islands for a cold drink and a swim in the
lake. There was a sprung diving board which made for some fun jumping into the
lake, which was a beautiful temperature. Most of the swimming I&#8217;d done on this
trip had been in salt water, so it was interesting to see how much more easily I
sank in fresh water.</p>

<h1 id="volcan-masaya">Volcan Masaya</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898349376/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Smoking volcano crater by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5595/14898349376_1c716d46db_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Smoking volcano crater" class="img-responsive"><em>Smoking volcano crater</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of the afternoon trips was to see an active volcano. It&#8217;s not actually
Volcan Masaya, which is apparently the dormant crater next to the Santiago
crater.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s definitely the easiest volcano you can summit, with the car park being
right on the crater rim.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734672750/in/set-72157646060932408" title="So smokey by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5590/14734672750_b3264785ed_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="So smokey" class="img-responsive"><em>So smokey</em></a></span></p>

<p>The day we visited it was pumping out a lot of cloudy gas; enough to block out
the sun. This also meant we couldn&#8217;t see much in the volcano. I&#8217;m told that the
lava at the bottom is about 120°C, which sounds pretty hot, but another one in
Nicaragua is supposed to be 400°C and glow much more brightly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734707909/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Walking up to the mirador by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3903/14734707909_c649759ed6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Walking up to the mirador" class="img-responsive"><em>Walking up to the mirador</em></a></span></p>

<p>We walked to a few different view points, then went up a nearby hill which
passed the dormant Masaya volcano.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734767028/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5559/14734767028_d85f13f09c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>We watched the sunset from the top of the hill, with the gases from the volcano
giving us beautiful oranges, purples and blues.</p>

<p>After sunset, we went to the mouth of a cave after sunset, where tons of bats
flying out to do their thing for the evening. It&#8217;s amazing how fast they fly and
yet how rarely they collide with anything.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14921400105/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Hard hat zone by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3868/14921400105_f166c4387a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Hard hat zone" class="img-responsive"><em>Hard hat zone</em></a></span></p>

<p>We put on safety hats and got torches, and went 180M down into another tunnel
which was formed by lava flow &#8220;recently&#8221; (800 years?). Pretty cool to see all
the blue volcanic stone and bubbles. Tree roots were creeping in from the
ceiling giving it a fantastical sort of feeling. When we reached the deepest
point in the cave that we would visit, we all turned off our torches briefly to
experience total darkness. Spoiler: it was black.</p>

<h1 id="la-boquita">La Boquita</h1>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898423946/in/set-72157646060932408" title="La Boquita by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5565/14898423946_5f76a44c76_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="La Boquita" class="img-responsive"><em>La Boquita</em></a></span></p>

<p>One Saturday we went to visit a beach down on the Pacific coast named La
Boquita. It was a blistering hot day, which mostly consisted of sitting around
chatting with people in the shade, lying in hammocks reading, having a swim in
the waves, and eating seafood for lunch.</p>

<p>There were quite large and powerful waves with a fair bit of current. It was
loads of fun to bodysurf in, although it was pretty hard to keep your head up
when riding a wave and I did get tumbled over in somersaults involuntarily a
number of times.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734844617/in/set-72157646060932408" title="La Boquita by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5569/14734844617_4928b29d29_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="La Playa" class="img-responsive"><em>La Playa</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went out in the water with Kimberly and her son, Finn, a few times to put
Kim&#8217;s mind at ease about having an 8 year old in the water. Finn was determined
that he wanted to go out further, much to Kim&#8217;s dismay. We took him out pretty
far (for an 8 year old) and he seemed to be having a great time.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#8217;m finally starting to come around to kids a bit. I still don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ll ever want one, but I think I&#8217;m reaching a point where it won&#8217;t grate
on me to spend time around them once they&#8217;re past the screaming poo factory
stages. Maybe being an uncle some day would be cool.</p>

<p>I had delicious ceviche for lunch (raw fish which is &#8220;cooked&#8221; using the acidity
of lemon juice, no heat involved), then was fed leftover fish from everyone
else&#8217;s enormous lunches. Thanks guys!</p>

<h1 id="horseback-riding">Horseback Riding</h1>

<p>One Sunday morning I went horseback riding with two other students, Nicole and
Caitlin, on some of the horses that live on the school&#8217;s farm.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918342771/in/set-72157646060932408" title="I'm on a horse by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5556/14918342771_ed49e169d2_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="I'm on a horse" class="img-responsive"><em>I&#8217;m on a horse</em></a></span></p>

<p>The horses looked to be well cared for, we climbed on and were given zero
instructions, so Nicole (an experienced rider) and one of the guides were off
out in front while the rest of us trotted along quite slowly, but still at a
much more consistent pace than the poor pony I rode in Thailand years ago that
only wanted to stop.</p>

<p>After a while we regrouped and took a break, and Nicole gave me a brief rundown
of how to tell the horse what I wanted it to do, and I suddenly found that the
horse was actually very good at doing what it was told. I was much more able to
keep up and even led for a bit.</p>

<p>On a open flat patch I got the horse up to a decent speed, maybe a canter? It
was novel to see how suddenly the ride became much smoother than when we&#8217;d been
moving at a slower pace.</p>

<p>At this new faster pace I was a little scared at first, until I remembered being
told I could wrap my legs around the horses belly to secure myself a little
better, after which it stopped feeling like I was going to bounce off.</p>

<p>All up we rode for a bit over an hour, and after getting the hang of it it was
lots of fun.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14921422575/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Baby horse by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3841/14921422575_94bc6d51a4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Baby horse" class="img-responsive"><em>Baby horse</em></a></span></p>

<p>When we were done we went into the stables and saw a baby foal, barely a few
months old. Tiny horses are very cute!</p>

<p>Around this point I started to sneeze quite violently and repeatedly. My nose
has been a bit twichy before then, but being the in stables seemed to put me
over the edge and into a sneezing fit. Pretty sure I have an allergy to horses
as the sneezing lessened when I went away, but my ichy eyes and a blocked nose
were barely helped by antihistamines later. It kind of sucks to find a new
activity you enjoy, only to find it causes you a lot of other discomfort.</p>

<h1 id="managua">Managua</h1>

<p>On another afternoon excursion I visited the Capital of Nicaragua, Managua, with
Debra, Caitlin and Amanda. There&#8217;s a lot of concrete in the capital, and as such
it feel like it&#8217;s a billion degrees even though it&#8217;s only an hour away from the
relatively cool school.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734896177/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Very old human footprints by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3918/14734896177_546e15f5cc_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Very old human footprints" class="img-responsive"><em>Very old human footprints</em></a></span></p>

<p>We visited a museum with fossilised footprints, some of the oldest known
footprints on earth, thought to have been created by people evacuating from an
erupting volcano through the mud, with the volcanic ash promptly filling them,
preserving them for centuries.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734906928/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Church ruin left by the earthquake by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3840/14734906928_ea74d3b792_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Church ruin left by the earthquake" class="img-responsive"><em>Church ruin left by the earthquake</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went to the National Museum, which fronted onto a big square next to a leafy
park and the skeleton of a cathedral, made structurally unsound in the big
earthquake in 1979.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735333247/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Laguna poluto by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3880/14735333247_aeaa7bd994_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Laguna polluto" class="img-responsive"><em>Laguna polluto</em></a></span></p>

<p>We also visited the site of Samoza&#8217;s palace site, which has a lookout over the
city, and on the other side into a laguna, which is apparently still
suffering the pollution from dumping sewerage into it during Samoza&#8217;s reign.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735325407/in/set-72157646060932408" title="The basement of Samozsa's Palace by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3869/14735325407_e833c446ee_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The basement of Samoza's Palace" class="img-responsive"><em>The basement of Samoza&#8217;s Palace</em></a></span></p>

<p>The only thing left of Samoza&#8217;s palace was the basement, although the other
walls are opened up now and it is now home to a Sandinista museum.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735343797/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Pretty lights by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3853/14735343797_69065af209_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pretty lights" class="img-responsive"><em>Pretty lights</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went capped off the day going out for dinner at a restaurant by the lake. The
wind coming of the lake made the heat fade away, and it was a lovely evening of
nice food, good rum, and great company.</p>

<h1 id="len">León</h1>

<p>Another weekend trip, a visit to León required an early start to the day,
getting up at 5:30 to head to the Mariposa to start the long bus ride to León.</p>

<p>We stopped along the way next to lake Managua to have a look at the view of
Momotombo, one of the many volcanoes across Nicaragua.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735275559/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Quecillo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5553/14735275559_17f2a89847_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Quecillo" class="img-responsive"><em>Quecillo</em></a></span></p>

<p>We made another stop just outside of León to buy quesillos for breakfast. They
basically a tortilla wrapped around a hunk of cheese (kind of like feta), put in
a little plastic bag and drowned in runny cheese liquid. I ended up having two
because they were so good.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15469512481/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Weaving on table looms by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3941/15469512481_96a4d84c36_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Weaving on table looms" class="img-responsive"><em>Weaving on table looms</em></a></span></p>

<p>First stop in León was at a family weaving co op, which uses hand operated table
looms to make woven fabrics. We were shown how they make some of the detailed
patterned fabrics using a more complicated loom with four pedals pressed in
different orders. Quite clever stuff!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15449613506/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Up on the roof of the cathedral by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3947/15449613506_062ae62186_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Up on the roof of the cathedral" class="img-responsive"><em>Up on the roof of the cathedral</em></a></span></p>

<p>Next we went to León cathedral, a huge big building currently in the process of
being repainted white. We were able to pay and go up to the roof but it was not
your normal bell tower climb. We went up some narrow stairs next to a 2 story
drop with no hand railing, then out onto the big cylindrical rooftop with no
visible railings to stop you falling off the side of the building if you
slipped. We got a nice view of the city, but I was more surprised/impressed by
the fact we were allowed up there at all. No liability issues here I guess!</p>

<p>Outside the church was big mural that graphically covers the history of
Nicaragua. By this point I was starting to actually feel like I knew a lot of
the important bits of the story, although I suck at remembering specific names
and dates.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15286043650/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Paper mache figures by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3930/15286043650_38d137a8b8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Paper mache figures" class="img-responsive"><em>Paper mache figures</em></a></span></p>

<p>After lunch we went to the museum of Myths and Legends. It is hosted in a
building than used to be an old jail, opened in 1921 and closed in 1979. It
contained lots of mannequins of famous Nicaraguans, which if believed to be
anatomically accurate tell us that the famous poet Ruben Dario had a tiny little head.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15286192457/in/set-72157648514224155" title="Skeletons by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3946/15286192457_418ca40d69_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Skeletons" class="img-responsive"><em>Skeletons</em></a></span></p>

<p>Lots of the myths sounded like they were made up to scare children and husbands
into behaving themselves. Nicaraguans seem to be very superstitious. A golden
crab seemed to show up a lot, with various versions of the tale saying if you
caught him you&#8217;d either have something great happen to you, or something
terrible, depending on which story you believed. Nice and consistent.</p>

<h1 id="laguna-apoyo">Laguna Apoyo</h1>

<p>The last excursion, which I actually stayed an extra few days to go along on,
was to Laguna Apoyo, a volcanic crater, now filled with water forming a lake.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735363988/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Laguna Apoyo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3853/14735363988_fc13c94049_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Laguna Apoyo" class="img-responsive"><em>Laguna Apoyo</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was a very chilled day of relaxing in the sun. I spent quite a while out
floating on the lake in a tire tube, which was more effort than you&#8217;d expect
since wind blowing over the surface of the lake was causing waves to form and
take me back towards the shore.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898987456/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Laguna Apoyo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3849/14898987456_62917d3981_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Laguna Apoyo" class="img-responsive"><em>Laguna Apoyo</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was nice to spend a last day together with my Mariposa friends, chatting,
eating lunch, and resting in the sun. A perfect way to end of month of fairly
intense learning.</p>

<p>One of the goal I set for myself that I wanted to achieve in my travels was to
learn a second language. Years ago, right after living in Europe (where every
other person you meet seems to speak 4 languages) I had a go at learning Spanish
in Melbourne but I never found the opportunity to practice outside of class and
my interest waned. Being in Latin America it seemed like a good time to try
again.</p>

<p>I had heard about a school in Nicaragua near Masaya called &#8220;La Mariposa&#8221; from
Nick at Poi Love Camp. I did a bit of my own research and the place looked
really good, so I signed up for a month of intensive lessons.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898204176/in/set-72157646060932408" title="One of the many paths at in the school forest by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3916/14898204176_d012b81354_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="One of the many paths at in the school forest" class="img-responsive"><em>One of the many paths at in the school forest</em></a></span></p>

<p>The school is set amongst it&#8217;s own little plot of forest with all kinds of
plants and flowers growing, and quite a few coffee plants too. There were little
sheltered structures around the forests in which the classes often took place</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734681567/in/set-72157646060932408" title="P1200563.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3862/14734681567_ceccfd311c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="P1200563.jpg" class="img-responsive"><em>P1200563.jpg</em></a></span></p>

<p>The place was full of rescue animals. I think there were 11-12 rescue dogs on
the school grounds alone (there was a separate farm that I think had another
20 or so dogs), a number of cats, there was some rescued white-headed capuchin
monkeys, and lots of birds including a pair of beautiful toucans.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898247896/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Sleeping dogs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5596/14898247896_c6a9620dbe_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Sleeping dogs" class="img-responsive"><em>Sleeping dogs</em></a></span></p>

<p>All the dogs seemed to be totally friendly to any of the students, from the
first moment they arrived, but when a unknown local showed up they would all
bark like crazy. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s because Nicaraguan don&#8217;t treat dogs very well.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918356031/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Ol' Barkey, loves to bark happily at nothing at all by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3904/14918356031_2658312997_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Ol' Barkey, loves to bark happily at nothing at all" class="img-responsive"><em>Ol&#8217; Barkey, loves to bark happily at nothing at all</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was one old senile dog who I took a real liking too, who would just
randomly bark at nothing, sitting happily and calmly between barks. He&#8217;d
sometimes set off all the other dogs, and then just go back to sitting and
smiling. Maybe he thought he was telling the turkeys to stay in their turkey
enclosure, I don&#8217;t know :P</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734617077/in/set-72157646060932408" title="My Caba&#xF1;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5584/14734617077_07b32f0275_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My Caba&#xF1;a" class="img-responsive"><em>My Caba&#xF1;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>I initially chose to stay in their very nice private cabaña because I didn&#8217;t feel
like I&#8217;d have enough language to do a homestay. The cabaña was lovely, away from
the school and the hotel buildings, out in the forest so you could hear all
sorts of animal sounds in the evenings. It was a little 2 storey building made
of a material like bamboo, comprising of three separate rooms for students. The
walls were full of gaps so it was pretty much open air. There was a mosquito net
but after a few nights I started to wonder if it was even needed, tried sleeping
one night without it and found I didn&#8217;t get any bites so I stopped using it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918206221/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Tailles whip scorpion by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3854/14918206221_e947eaa47f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Tailles whip scorpion" class="img-responsive"><em>Tailles whip scorpion</em></a></span></p>

<p>One night I had what I thought was a spider come out in the cabaña, and I made a
deal with him that if he didn&#8217;t move he could stay. I looked away for a while
and he disappeared, but I heard he visited the next person who stayed too. I
showed the photo to a guy who knows about bugs and it turns out he&#8217;s not a
spider, but a tailless whip scorpion. I found another one in the shower one
night and saw him move, and these guy can move crazy fast!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14921336735/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Toucan by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5584/14921336735_bc23f284bf_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Toucan" class="img-responsive"><em>Toucan</em></a></span></p>

<p>Mornings I would wake to the sound of all the birds making as much noise as they
could. I was quite surprised to find out that toucans actually make a sound that
sounds like a frog croaking. I don&#8217;t know what sound I expected them to make,
but that wasn&#8217;t it!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735389279/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Some of the loveliest people at la Mariposa by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3855/14735389279_6c72440139_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Some of the loveliest people at la Mariposa" class="img-responsive"><em>Some of the loveliest people at la Mariposa</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was constant stream of interesting people coming and going each week, far
too numerous to try and list. Everyone from students to doctors, landscape
designers to masseuses. There was a huge cross sections of ages from children
all the way through to retirees. Everyone I met was really interesting, coming
from all walks of life with all different motivations for learning Spanish. I
think the people really made the month for me and I hope to run into many
of you again in the future.</p>

<p>All meals were provided at the school, a delicious buffet of mostly vegetarian
cuisine. Beans and rice were a staple, but there was a nice selection of salad
and other vegetables too, and occasionally some chicken. Everything looked so
tasty that you never felt guilty about going back for seconds when there was
enough. Maybe a dangerous illusion!</p>

<p>The intensive lessons consisted of four hours of 1-on-1 classes per day, five
days a week. The time was split into two hours of grammar, and two hours of
conversation. You got a new conversation teacher each week, but kept the same
grammar teacher throughout unless you ask to change.</p>

<p>I initially got a grammar teacher who spoke absolutely no English, and was
hopeful that it would mean I&#8217;d have no choice but to pick things up quickly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14898236806/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Chooks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3876/14898236806_a366d33a74_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Chooks" class="img-responsive"><em>Chooks</em></a></span></p>

<p>It turns out that&#8217;s not the way my brain works at all, and I just found myself
frustrated to no end by not having my questions answered because my Spanish wasn&#8217;t
good enough to express them; And so I changed after the first week to someone
who had at least a little bit of English.</p>

<p>Maybe it works for some people, but when it comes to something dry, complicated
and arbitrary like grammar, I feel being able to ask &#8220;why?&#8221;, even if the answer
is just &#8220;because that&#8217;s how it is&#8221; is very important. Asking why about something
specific that&#8217;s bothering you, and then having the high-level basic concept
repeated at me more loudly and more slowly just made me frustrated and put me in
a state where I didn&#8217;t seem to absorb any new information.</p>

<p>My other grammar teacher suited me much better, although I feel that learning
grammar in such a robotic way isn&#8217;t really ideal for me. There must be a better
way, since I can speak English without really knowing the grammar. I actually
questioned my English teaching mother why I don&#8217;t remember ever formally
learning English grammar and apparently they phased it out when <em>she</em> was a
child, in favour of teaching it through immersion. Hence why I can&#8217;t say why
something is correct or incorrect English, but I can tell you when something
sounds wrong.</p>

<p>My conversation classes were much more enjoyable, covering all sorts of topics
from how life in Australia differs to Nicaragua (a lot), the government, to drug
policies and illegal animal fighting. It was good having a new teacher every
week to keep the conversations fresh.</p>

<p>Classes where pretty flexible; if you wanted to make a trip into town you could
do so with your teacher in tow, allowing you to ask questions and come across
conversation topics that you might not otherwise think of. I even interrupted one
class to buy my ticket to Burning Man. A good thing I did too, since they sold
out in 45 minutes; it definitely couldn&#8217;t have waited until after class.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14734768958/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3894/14734768958_4c67bf81a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Beautiful colours in the smokey sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>Pretty much every afternoon, and full days on weekends, the school ran
activities that you could go along on.  Activities included things like visiting
a nearby nature reserve, trips to nearby cities (Leon, Managua, Masaya,
Granada), dinners out, visiting local volcanoes, a trip to the beach, horseback
riding, a tour of an organic dried fruit processing plant, a visit to Laguna
Apoyo and salsa classes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735363988/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Laguna Apoyo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3853/14735363988_fc13c94049_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Laguna Apoyo" class="img-responsive"><em>Laguna Apoyo</em></a></span></p>

<p>Initially I went along to way too many activities, and felt that I did not have
enough time for study. Later started being a bit more picky and choosier so I
could try and be a good student too.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735343797/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Pretty lights by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3853/14735343797_de55c0b041_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pretty lights" class="img-responsive"><em>Pretty lights</em></a></span></p>

<p>One of my favourite regular activities was the weekly talk about the history of
Nicaragua, spoken in very clear, slow Spanish, then translated into English for
those of us without enough vocabulary yet. It was great to see my comprehension
progress each week and it was really interesting to learn about Nicaraguan
history, and made visiting a lot of historic sites more interesting because I
actually knew the stories behind them.</p>

<p>About half way through the month I decided that staying at the school in the
cabaña was letting me be lazy and speak too much English with other students, so
I asked if I could move into a homestay.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918977571/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Jamy, Paola and Camila by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3838/14918977571_207c20c6c7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Jamy, Paola and Camila" class="img-responsive"><em>Jamy, Paola and Camila</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got placed in a home with host mother Jamy, whose daughter Paola and son-in-law
live with them, along with their 2 year old child Camila. Camila was very shy
the first night I arrived, not even saying &#8220;hola&#8221;, but warmed right up to me the
next day, trying to show me every one of her toys, one by one (btw, to a 2 year
old a deck of cards is 52 toys), and by the end I was &#8220;Tio Lucas&#8221;. So cute!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735355189/in/set-72157646060932408" title="My homestay house by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3916/14735355189_9d270afc6a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My homestay house" class="img-responsive"><em>My homestay house</em></a></span></p>

<p>The house was a fairly traditional Nicaraguan house, quite rustic and open,
walls without ceilings under the roof so it was nice and airy. The area, San
Juan de la Concepción, is in drought so they only have running water a few times
per week, which mean that the toilet was flushed with buckets, and showers were
also of the bucket variety. It&#8217;s amazing how little water you really need to get
clean (although maybe I&#8217;d feel differently if I had long hair).</p>

<p>Homestay food was a bit different than food at La Mariposa. Lots of beans and
rice and chicken for dinner and eggs for breakfast. Nothing a bit of hot sauce
can&#8217;t salvage, but I did miss all the healthy veggies I had gotten used to. I
was glad that we still got lunch at the school, even in the homestay.</p>

<p>Noise levels in town during the nights wasn&#8217;t quite as serene as at the school.
It sounded like there were hundreds of dogs running around barking at each other
every single night. Endlessly. All night. I&#8217;m lucky enough to be a heavy
sleeper, so once I got to sleep I was fine.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14922026385/in/set-72157646060932408" title="Where I learnt how to do laundry with a wash board by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3839/14922026385_204520233b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Where I learnt how to do laundry with a wash board" class="img-responsive"><em>Where I learnt how to do laundry with a wash board</em></a></span></p>

<p>One weekend I asked Jamy to demonstrate for me how the old style washboard hand
washing laundry worked but she ended up doing pretty much all of my washing for
me! I did have a go and found that it&#8217;s harder work than it looks, although it&#8217;s
easier than hand washing in a bathroom sink.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my month my grammar teacher started to really pick up the
pace, sometimes covering two or three tenses in a day, getting right through to
the subjunctive. At the time I was thinking it was way more than I needed, but
I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s made revisiting those topics much easier as the seeds have
all been planted.</p>

<p>By the end of a month of study I had learnt a lot of study, and a lot more about
how I learn. I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d be much better after a month, but I&#8217;m much slower
at learning spoken languages than I&#8217;m used to. With most other things, I feel
like I only need to be shown a quick over view and I can figure out the rest,
but with languages the way I think just doesn&#8217;t help. Too many exceptions to
rules, and too many irregularities for me to just &#8220;get a feel for it&#8221;. It feels
like I&#8217;m gonna have to ROTE learn a bunch of stuff if I&#8217;m ever going to get to
where I want to be. Looking at it as a challenge for myself; I need to figure
out something that works for me or I&#8217;ll bore myself to death with repetition :P</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535655259/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3835/14535655259_8660ab6035_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Montezuma sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>So after I was finished in Uvita I headed to the next place along the coast of
Costa Rica that seems to get rave reviews, Montezuma. Montezuma is described by
guidebooks and Lonely Planet tourists as some beautiful and undiscovered hippy
beach town, so I went there expecting maybe something like Byron Bay was 10-15
years ago.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I was sorely let down, and I feel all those people need a strong reality check.
The place is horribly overrun by tourists. It felt like the last real local had
left years ago and now there is nothing but pot smoking gringos, pretending
they&#8217;re in some hippy paradise. Or maybe that is hippy paradise, and I&#8217;m just
jaded. Having grown up close to both Byron Bay (when it was far less developed
than it is today) and Nimbin (where at least there are pot smoking locals too),
I felt Montezuma brought nothing of interest to the table.</p>

<p>I had a huge amount of trouble finding a decent room. Most places I tried were
full up, with the remaining places either being empty and super creepy, or
without lockers. Not cool at all with the reputation this place has specifically
for thieves breaking into hostel rooms. Eventually I found a place with room for
me but it was a complete dive.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535853397/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3870/14535853397_2cb0f86dc2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Montezuma" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma</em></a></span></p>

<p>I tried to switch hostels to one of the highly rated places the next day to see
if my opinion on the place would change, but they were full up again so I reserved a
bed for the following day after that.</p>

<p>I really tried to give the town a good chance, but even after moving hostels to
the fully booked one, no one was ever around. For a town that was full up in
terms of accommodation, it was strangely like a ghost town during the day. It
seemed like everyone staying in Montezuma disappeared off to snorkelling tours
or surfing lessons in other towns&#8230; Why exactly do people come here again?</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t all shit though.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719920754/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Cliff diving by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2920/14719920754_8811d76f8a_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Cliff diving" class="img-responsive"><em>Cliff diving</em></a></span></p>

<p>I decided to go see the waterfall, and that turned out to be really worthwhile.
The walk to the falls was pretty easy, a lot of rock hopping over the steam
leading away from the falls. The bottom fall was very beautiful, with lots of
people swimming in the pool at the bottom or sunning themselves on the
surrounding rocks. It looked like it would be very dangerous to jump off, but
that didn&#8217;t stop some folk.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535670980/in/set-72157645450071209" title="This was part of the path to the top by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2937/14535670980_401cf4fdec_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="This was part of the path to the top" class="img-responsive"><em>This was part of the path to the top</em></a></span></p>

<p>I climbed up to the top of the second fall via the alternate path. There were
some extremely steep parts where you only really had a rope to hold on to to
climb up and down, almost like abseiling. The path went up quite a bit higher
than the falls, around the side and then came back down to the top of the falls.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719940384/in/set-72157645450071209" title="A local jumping down the second falls by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3841/14719940384_922db43cea_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="A local jumping down the second falls" class="img-responsive"><em>A local jumping down the second falls</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were lots of people up there, some Ticos were jumping down the second
waterfall into the pool below it. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s 15M, and it looks like a fairly
safe jump straight down. I heard some long screams before they finally hit the
water. However, being a solo traveller with no one there to look out for me I wasn&#8217;t
willing to jump myself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719914944/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Montezuma waterfall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3905/14719914944_1052cf80c1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Montezuma waterfall" class="img-responsive"><em>Montezuma waterfall</em></a></span></p>

<p>I climbed back down to the bottom falls, and went for a swim there. It was cool
that you could get right against the rocks, behind the water curtain and hear
the falls pounding down in front of you.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14719948464/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Mc Mary's by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3890/14719948464_cd40d3e8a7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Mc Mary's" class="img-responsive"><em>Mc Mary&#8217;s</em></a></span></p>

<p>On my last night there, while wandering around the streets waiting to see the
fire show that happens on Thursday nights, I met a friendly American couple who
waiting for reggae night in one of the bars to start and spend the night talking
with them. It just so happened they were driving to Santa Teresa the next day
and so they offered me a lift there with them in their air conditioned 4WD.
Score! Sure beats the bus!</p>

<p>I found Santa Teresa to be a much nicer place than Montezuma. There&#8217;s a long
surf beach going for kilometres in either direction, mostly with a sandy bottom
perfect for learning.</p>

<p>I walked the whole length of the beach on the day I arrived to get an idea where
places were, all the way down to Playa Carmen; a long enough walk that my legs
were sore afterwards.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14699346436/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Boards in the surf shop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3910/14699346436_f7fe1aa431_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Boards in the surf shop" class="img-responsive"><em>Boards in the surf shop</em></a></span></p>

<p>I took a surf lesson with Al Chilli Surf Shop, with a group consisting of two
German girls and a Korean girl. We were shown how to jump up, practiced on the
sand a bunch of times and then went out into the surf with the instructor
holding the board and telling us to paddle and jump up as the waves came
through.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14742224093/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Francisco and me by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3864/14742224093_c67dbbdf08_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Francisco and me" class="img-responsive"><em>Francisco and me</em></a></span></p>

<p>I managed to get up and ride the wave all the way in a few times, and towards
the end managed a few times completely unassisted; I was pretty happy with that!</p>

<p>I happened to be in Santa Teresa at the time of a full moon, and one of the
beach bars was having a big full moon party which I went along to with some
people from the hostel. It was a pretty big night with loads of people. I got to
practice some Spanish on some locals and didn&#8217;t get home until the sun was up.</p>

<p>I felt like crap the next day, awake by 9am because of the heat, but I went out
surfing anyway because I had 24 hours of free board rental with my lesson. I was
really struggling to paddle hard enough because I was so tired, but still got up
a few times.</p>

<p>I had not been paying enough attention and the current took me about a kilometre
down along the beach. When I came back in I had no idea where. It took me ages
to figure out which direction I needed to walk to get back, barefoot on the hot
road, then back down to the beach to get my flip-flops.</p>

<p>I went out again the next afternoon with a bit more energy and seemed to be
getting up a bit more easily, but most of the waves were just dumping over in
one go, so you couldn&#8217;t properly catch them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14722051542/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Kaya by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2926/14722051542_4ff893ee25_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Kaya" class="img-responsive"><em>Kaya</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ran into Kaya, one of the German girls from the lesson, and her boyfriend
Francisco and hung out with them for the afternoon and organised to meet up
early the next day for a surf. I also went back to the shop and swapped out my
giant 2.8 metre board for an 2.6 metre one, to see how I went with a shorter one
the next day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535901417/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Francisco, Kaya and me having breakfast by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3866/14535901417_5b2d7f0e6b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Francisco, Kaya and me having breakfast" class="img-responsive"><em>Francisco, Kaya and me having breakfast</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next morning we were in the surf at 6am and the waves were pretty good for
about half an hour, but then the surf went flat so we went and had breakfast
together, before going our separate ways for the day, with me having a good nap.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14742224093/in/set-72157645450071209" title="Francisco and me by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3864/14742224093_c67dbbdf08_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Francisco and me" class="img-responsive"><em>Francisco and me</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went back down to the beach at 3pm for another surf and the waves were much
better. I actually managed to catch a couple before they had fully broken, a
sensation that feels much faster and a whole lot more fun. I ran into Kaya and
Francisco again and it turned out they were heading up the peninsula in their
car the next day, the same direction as me, and offered me a lift to Liberia.
Score!</p>

<p>The drive up the peninsula had roads of quite varying quality. From Santa Teresa
to the close ferry port was pretty OK. From there to the far ferry port was
crazy bumpy and torn up so we crawled along very slowly for that part, but once
we were past there the roads were pretty great so we made good time.</p>

<p>Kaya and Francisco kindly dropped me off at a nice little hotel in Liberia,
where I spent my last night in Costa Rica before getting the bus to the
Nicaraguan border early in the morning.</p>

<p>Next stop for me was a little town on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica called
Uvita. I found a place online called Flutterby hostel and after getting dropped
off by the bus I walked to the hostel, which actually turned out to be a
reasonably long walk in very hot sun. When I arrived the girl behind the desk
said it was pretty gutsy showing up with no reservation, but I was pleased to
find they had a bed for me in their pirate tree-house dorm: one of the coolest
dorms I&#8217;ve stayed in so far! The dorm doesn&#8217;t really have any walls; it&#8217;s pretty
much open to nature and then every bed has a mozzie net. So chilled!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The reason I came to Uvita was to do some dives near Caño Island, so the first
thing I did was get myself booked in. There wasn&#8217;t a boat going out there for 3-4
days but I felt like this would be a nice place to stop for a while so I was
quite alright with that.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14717675851/in/set-72157645848999661" title="Waterfall/slide by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3875/14717675851_b35a4a0237_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterfall/slide" class="img-responsive"><em>Waterfall/slide</em></a></span></p>

<p>One morning I went for a walk to the Uvita waterfall. It&#8217;s only about 3-4 meters
tall, but the rocks it flows down are all smooth and mossy so you can go down it
like a water slide. It was pretty awesome fun! There was a tour guide there who
was showing his clients where you could climb up onto a ledge another meter or
so up and jump off, so I followed them up and took the plunge. It was quite
exhilarating, having been years since I&#8217;d jumped off anything remotely tall!</p>

<p>Another afternoon I went out to see the &#8220;whale tail&#8221;, a sand and rock formation
in the shape of a whale tail that becomes exposed for a few hours at low tide
each day. I rented a snorkel, and stupidly decided to try and climb out over the
rocks to get to the drop off without having to swim so far. That was a big
mistake as my feet were torn to shreds, and once I got close to the drop off the
size of the swell smashing into the rocks made it appear way too unsafe to get
out that way anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid">
<img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/wp-content/uploads/UvitaWhaleTail.jpg" />
<em>Shamelessly stolen photo of the whale tail</em></span></p>

<p>I ended up going all the way back into the sandy part of the tail, and then
snorkelling out along the edge of the rocks. The visibility for the first 20
meters was absolutely terrible, maybe 20-30cm and I nearly turned back at that
point, but I was happy to find that it cleared right up as I got a little
further out.  I saw some huge trigger fish that looked about the size of a small
titan trigger, but with different colouring and they didn&#8217;t seem at all aggressive.
There were loads and loads more fish here than I&#8217;d gotten used to diving in the
Mediterranean; I didn&#8217;t even get out past the water 1.5-2M deep and the fish
were still pretty plentiful.</p>

<p>The day that I got to go diving I got picked up from the hostel bright and early
by a girl from the dive shop, fitted out with gear and met the other divers.
They were a friendly bunch of expats from all over the place. Columbia,
Venezuela, Germany, Argentina, USA; all over! Everyone else spoke Spanish so I
had some good chances to practice listening, and sometimes they&#8217;d repeat parts
in English which let me see see how close my own translation was.</p>

<p>The boat ride out to Caño island took about 90 minutes, we were taken to shore
to sign in to the marine park while the crew sorted out everyone&#8217;s gear on board
the little boat. It was the smallest boat I&#8217;ve ever been on for such a long boat
ride. The ocean was glassy smooth that day; I took motion sickness pills as I
always do but I probably didn&#8217;t really need them after all. Still, I&#8217;d prefer to
eliminate the slightest chance of feeling seasick cause there are few sensations
worse.</p>

<em>Shamelessly stolen photo of sharks</em><em>(because I have no underwater camera)</em></span></p>

<p>On the first dive we got to the bottom of the buoy line and there was 2 white
tip reef sharks waiting there for us on the bottom, who chilled out for a bit
before they swam off. There were huge, huge schools of fish of all different
sorts, some so thick they&#8217;d cast a cloud-like shadow. I was able to swim calmly
right through a few big schools and they didn&#8217;t seem too fussed by our presence.
Throughout the dive we saw even more reef sharks, probably 6-7 in total, which I
was super stoked about.</p>

<p>We went back to shore of the island for our surface interval, and ate some
delicious pineapple. Boy do I love tropical fruit in the tropics! They all just
taste so much more sweet and flavoursome!</p>

<p>The second dive was even more crazy, with even thicker schools of fish, and an
absolutely silly number of sharks. At one point there was six sharks all
sleeping on the bottom in a group, until they noticed us sneaking up to have a
look after which they took off in different directions and settled down
elsewhere. It was hard to count an exact number, but I think we could have seen
any number of sharks between 6 and 15. Maybe it was just the same sharks over
and over, but it felt like there were at least 10 different ones down there.</p>

<p>The German guy with us actually snuck up on one and touched it&#8217;s tail, and later
told me how it&#8217;s possible to turn them over and rub their belly and they go into
a trance like state until they get flipped over right way up again. I&#8217;d love to
see it some day.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly impressed by both dives at Caño Island, they were definitely
worth the wait, the long boat ride and the higher than average cost of the
dives. Those two dives were easily among my top 10 dives, if not my top 5.</p>

<p>At the hostel throughout the week I noticed a bunch of fliers around the place
for a festival that was on that weekend called BestFest. It turned out the
hostel was pretty much booked out all weekend as accommodation for performers
and crew, which meant that I met a few of the guys involved with the festival,
Franklin and his wife Kristin, Jamin and his girlfriend Marty. Franklin and his
wife turned out to be some of the friendliest people I&#8217;ve ever met and they
seemed to know absolutely everyone, so I got introduced to more people than I
can remember.</p>

<p>Marty was performing at the festival with fire poi and thought she might be able
to get me in as her fire safety, which would have be pretty awesome. It didn&#8217;t
eventuate, but it did get me over the line deciding that this was something I
wanted to get along to.</p>

<p>As luck would have it the fully booked hostel managed to find a bed for me so I
could stay throughout the weekend, so it was decided, I was going to BestFest.</p>

<p>I got a lift to the festival with Franklin and Kristin, and since they were crew
we got to drive right into the festival, and into the &#8220;backstage&#8221; part of the
site.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14721337765/in/set-72157645848999661" title="Best Fest 2013 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2904/14721337765_e65b9fd0ab_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Best Fest 2013" class="img-responsive"><em>Best Fest 2013</em></a></span></p>

<p>I actually got to spend quite a bit of time in the crew area of the site
throughout the festival, since most of the people I&#8217;d met seemed to be back
there. Ever now and then security would block me from getting back there without
a crew pass, but I&#8217;d always manage to find another way in because I&#8217;m sneaky
like that.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14534245238/in/set-72157645848999661" title="Best Fest 2013 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2925/14534245238_ffbe7e753e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Best Fest 2013" class="img-responsive"><em>Best Fest 2013</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was an interesting mix of music, a lot more bands and less electronic
stuff than I had expected. I met lots more cool people, but my terrible memory
for names really didn&#8217;t help me much here.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14720986082/in/set-72157645848999661" title="Best Fest 2013 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2925/14720986082_a541fb24dc_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Best Fest 2013" class="img-responsive"><em>Best Fest 2013</em></a></span></p>

<p>Two acts that stood out for me were Conspirator and Gramatik. Both were great
music to spin poi to, so I found some room up the back and spun for most of both
sets, leaving me pretty hot, tired and sweaty by the end.</p>

<p>I managed to get a lift back to the hostel in a minivan, which we crammed 13
people into. At the time I though this was way beyond a sane number of people
for such a vehicle, but that was before I&#8217;d been to Nicaragua :P</p>

<p>I got a really lovely compliment from Franklin and Kristin about how much
they&#8217;d enjoyed hanging out, and they let me know they&#8217;d pulled a few strings and
had managed to sort out a photography pass for me for the Sunday night! Such
complete legends!</p>

<p>Sunday night was a lot quieter than the Saturday, as one would expect, but it
was great to get more time to hang out with my new found friends. Very glad that
I crossed paths with those guys and I hope I run into them again some day soon!</p>

      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14512293446/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Puerto Jiminez by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5531/14512293446_1ce22f82a2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Puerto Jiminez" class="img-responsive"><em>Puerto Jiminez</em></a></span></p>

<p>After Poi Love Camp finished up I ended up travelling around Costa Rica for a
while with a guy I&#8217;ll just call ‘T&#8217;, together with a friend of his from France
who I&#8217;ll just call ‘A&#8217;. We headed up to San Jose to meet up with ‘A&#8217; at the
airport, then got a very long bus all the way down to the south eastern end of
the country to Golfito, where we stayed a night before getting a ferry over to
Puerto Jiminez the next day. The ferry was actually a cramped tiny little boat,
with so little room that our bags just got put up on the roof with no rope to
tie them down or railings to keep them up there. I was very pleased there were
still there when we reached the other side.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14348904158/in/set-72157645539710311" title="My first wild Macaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2897/14348904158_5756de5a83_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="My first wild Macaw" class="img-responsive"><em>My first wild Macaw</em></a></span></p>

<p>Right upon getting on land we saw our first wild scarlet macaws, beautiful big
red birds, fidgeting around eating in a tree. There were heaps of them around
down here, especially around the soccer field. It was not uncommon to see 5-6 of
them in the big trees along there. We also saw a wild toucan and a few large
tenasaurs in a tree directly out the front of someones home. Who needs tv when
you&#8217;ve got cool shit like that in your front yard?</p>

<p>We tracked down the tourism office to sort out permits for Corcovado National
Park, a drawn out process that involved getting a form from the office at one
end of town, going over to the bank at the other end of town to pay for the
permit, then going all the way back to the office with the receipt to get the
actual passes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14534495162/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Colourful houses in Puerto Jiminez by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2901/14534495162_302cd53ce9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Colourful houses in Puerto Jiminez" class="img-responsive"><em>Colourful houses in Puerto Jiminez</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were no camping passes available for the next day, so the other two opted
to get a day pass to walk in and around a bit, while I took a day to relax and
prepare for the 20 km hike into the camp ground where we would spend 2 nights
before hiking 20 km back out again, carrying in a tent and enough food and water
to survive three days.</p>

<p>At a vote of two against me, we opted not to go with a guide to save some money.
I later found out that as of the day we returned, it is now a requirement that
everyone uses a guide when they visit the park, so depending on how you look at
it we either got lucky (or unlucky) with our timing.</p>

<p>Even this early on I was getting the feeling this travel arrangement wasn&#8217;t
going to last long; ‘A&#8217; seemed like a bit of a fool to me, and the two of them
would speak together in French most of the time which was leaving me feeling
completely isolated, but I figured it would be worth sticking together for the
hike into the park at least for safety.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14532104671/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Decorative security bars on the window by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2933/14532104671_6f8edda7a7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Decorative security bars on the window" class="img-responsive"><em>Decorative security bars on the window</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent my day alone getting some laundry done, sorting out tent rental for all
of us, and getting food supplies for myself. We hadn&#8217;t discussed food beforehand
and I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should get stuff for them as well or what, but I got
myself a lot of energy dense food so I was sure I&#8217;d have enough to make it in
and back again comfortably without carrying too much weight. Basically a can of
tuna for every meal, some mixed nuts and some muesli bars and a 2.5 litres of
water.  I was a bit worried about the water being sufficient for the heat and
the distance, but with the food and the tent my bag was going to weigh a ton
already.</p>

<p>‘T&#8217; and ‘A&#8217; returned that evening, quite sunburnt and tired, warning me it was
going to be quite a difficult hike the next day and checking if I&#8217;d gotten food
for myself.</p>

<p>We were up at 5:15 the next morning to pack up out stuff we were leaving at the
hostel, and get the bus to Carate. A guy with a 4WD ended up offering to drive
us there for a comparable price so we went with that speedier option, and were
lucky enough to have an Ocelot run across the road right in front of us. A
pretty amazing sighting to start the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14555646753/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Birds Fishing by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3924/14555646753_68106e6bbc_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Birds Fishing" class="img-responsive"><em>Birds Fishing</em></a></span></p>

<p>When we arrive and get dropped off at the beach, instead of making a start
quickly and trying to get as much of the walk over with before the heat sets in,
I find out ‘T&#8217; has lost his lighter and so is trying to light his cigarette with
a magnifying glass, while ‘A&#8217; starts unpacking and repacking his backpack,
leaving me waiting around in full sun for 15 minutes while they fuck around,
eventually giving up on the smoke.</p>

<p>After we finally get going we make it maybe 400-500 metres down the back before
‘T&#8217; decides to stop again in full sun and try again. Not putting up with that
shit, I duck up to the tree line and sit in the shade watching the hundreds of
hermit crabs and lizards doing their thing, sensibly in the shade.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14349063487/in/set-72157645539710311" title="The whole beach to ourselves by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2915/14349063487_0b25cc2cc4_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The whole beach to ourselves" class="img-responsive"><em>The whole beach to ourselves</em></a></span></p>

<p>Eventually we make it to the first ranger station, about 2km in, and check in,
after which it is decided we need to have a rest. Keep in mind this is a 20km
hike we are attempting to make it to the camping ranger station.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14555674143/in/set-72157645539710311" title="This tractor has seen better days by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2923/14555674143_d82c8b6aea_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="This tractor has seen better days" class="img-responsive"><em>This tractor has seen better days</em></a></span></p>

<p>We get going again and are stopped another 5 minutes later because ‘A&#8217; realises
he&#8217;s left his sunglasses behind. It is like an episode of Fawlty Towers with
these guys.</p>

<p>We come to our first water crossing, a small stream no more than 50cm deep. ‘T&#8217;
carefully hops on rocks across it, and make it safely across. I take off my
shoes and socks, cross the knee deep water and put them back on again, also
keeping my shoes and socks dry. ‘A&#8217; just trudges right on across in his shoes,
with some 16 odd km left to walk that day. I really start to wonder about his
common sense, and experience in the outdoors.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14534620122/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Bizzare 'door' root by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3849/14534620122_85c353b303_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Bizzare 'door' root" class="img-responsive"><em>Bizzare &#8216;door&#8217; root</em></a></span></p>

<p>After about 6km of fairly intense sweaty hiking, we stop and have a rest and eat
something for lunch. After resting for a while ‘T&#8217; tells me that he and ‘A&#8217; are
going to return back tomorrow because they didn&#8217;t bring enough food. No fucking
shit! Your single tin of tuna, a sandwich, some bananas and a muesli bar each
aren&#8217;t enough for 3 days of intense fucking hiking. Even less so when you
started eating them the night before.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400863197/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Yet another rest stop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2920/14400863197_9c387b05d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Yet another rest stop" class="img-responsive"><em>Yet another rest stop</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty mad at this point. My bag weighs a ton because I brought enough food
for 3, maybe even 4 days, having factored in the possibility of getting lost and
some extra to share, and now it seems like I&#8217;m going to carry most of it back if
we only stay the one night in there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400757908/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Ant eater foraging by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5273/14400757908_840b034c22_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Ant eater foraging" class="img-responsive"><em>Ant eater foraging</em></a></span></p>

<p>After this it starts to really grate on me that 95% of conversion is in French
(admittedly I can&#8217;t say I wouldn&#8217;t do the same if roles were reversed), and lots
of sightings don&#8217;t get shared with me. I keep telling myself it is better to be
with them for safeties sake at least.</p>

<p>As we walk we see some good wildlife. Quite a lot of coati and ant eaters
wandering on the forest floor and macaws in the trees overhead.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14564280566/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Like a post card by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3903/14564280566_c5778953da_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Like a post card" class="img-responsive"><em>Like a post card</em></a></span></p>

<p>‘T&#8217; and ‘A&#8217; want to stop and rest every half km, but them seem to be in a huge
rush in the shade and dawdle along slowly in the sun. WTF?</p>

<p>‘A&#8217; is constantly stopping to mess around with his waterlogged shoes, taking out
the inner soles, turning his socks inside out. Who could have possibly foreseen
this would be an issue? Who?!?</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14585582894/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Waiting at the river crossing by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5550/14585582894_5bde373b57_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waiting at the river crossing" class="img-responsive"><em>Waiting at the river crossing</em></a></span></p>

<p>After nearly a whole day of walking we come to a big river, at least 20m across,
looking fairly deep and fast flowing. There are some other hikers resting with
their guide, waiting for the water level to drop. After an hour their guide
disappears to check if they can cross somewhere else. He comes back and tells
his customers he thinks they they can, and they promptly get up and get moving.
I say that I think we should follow them. ‘T&#8217; agrees. ‘A&#8217; fucks around for 10
minutes with his shoes so by the time we get moving there&#8217;s no trace of them.
Wonderful!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400922688/in/set-72157645539710311" title="It's deceiving but thats waist deep and flowing very very strongly by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3858/14400922688_9c522cac3e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="It's deceiving but thats waist deep and flowing very very strongly" class="img-responsive"><em>It&#8217;s deceiving but thats waist deep and flowing very very strongly</em></a></span></p>

<p>We head in the direction we saw them go and come out on the beach again, to find
them wading through the waist deep mouth of the river, everyone with their shoes
and pants off. We follow suit. The current is actually scarily strong but we all
make it across safely.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14607600793/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Here is where we actually crossed the river.

Great time to wash your stupid white pants!" class="img-responsive"><em>Here is where we actually crossed the river. Great time to wash your stupid white pants!</em></a></span></p>

<p>Everyone puts back on their pants, cleans off their feet and puts their shoes
on. Except of course ‘A&#8217;, who takes some photos of a stork, and decides now is a
good time to wash his white pants in the river (seriously, white pants trekking
in the jungle?).</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400967469/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Still fucking around by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2934/14400967469_27b7cec509_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Still fucking around" class="img-responsive"><em>Still fucking around</em></a></span></p>

<p>By the time he&#8217;s ready to go everyone we were following (in the end, about 10
people and two different guides) are completely out of sight.  We follow foot
prints but they disappear into the dunes with super thick vegetation and stop
being at all obvious.</p>

<p>We venture into the scrub a little, and almost right away get split up. I find a
promising looking clearing and go back out to the beach to find the other guys.</p>

<p>I find ‘A&#8217; knee deep in the surf, washing his feet with his shoes off yet again.
‘T&#8217; doesn&#8217;t want to head into the jungle without knowing for certain where the
path is.  The sun is less than half an hour from setting. I regret us not having a
guide more than ever at this point.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14400967469/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Still fucking around by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2934/14400967469_27b7cec509_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Still fucking around" class="img-responsive"><em>Still fucking around</em></a></span></p>

<p>They want to double back to where we crossed the river to try and find another
path. We do. They fail. ‘A&#8217; takes off his shoes again, just for a change.</p>

<p>Eventually I convince them to follow me into the forest, using the logic that if
there&#8217;s a path there, we just need to head in perpendicular from the beach to
find it. Sure enough I come to the path after about 200m of jungle stumbling. We
race along it in the face of lessening light from an already set sun, finally
coming to the camp as it gets dark! Success!</p>

<p>I put up my tent; it is a plain old dome tent so it is a pretty straightforward,
a 5 minute job. When I&#8217;m done I notice that the other two are still discussing
how the poles should go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m dripping with sweat, every inch of fabric I&#8217;m wearing is drenched, so I end
up showering in my clothes. Not having expected showers way out here, 20km into
the jungle I brought neither a change of clothes, nor a towel. It is a
refreshing shower, but the heavy humidity I think it might be a mistake.</p>

<p>I make the decision that I&#8217;m not going back the next day. I need to rest and I&#8217;d
rather risk being solo than have the liability of travelling with these guys.
I say goodbye to ‘T&#8217;. It is honestly a shame to split from him because he&#8217;s a
genuinely nice guy, but I just can&#8217;t stand ‘A&#8217;. I say instinctively &#8220;it was nice
to meet you&#8221; when saying goodbye to to ‘A&#8217; and he actually laughs at me. The
arrogant fuck! I definitely made the right choice going my own way; another day
with him and I&#8217;d probably be on trial for manslaughter.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401077858/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Morning sun rays by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3871/14401077858_b7472f0409_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Morning sun rays" class="img-responsive"><em>Morning sun rays</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got up the next day and head out into the jungle for a walk along some of the
paths. I followed the path back to the river to check how difficult it looks to
cross early in the morning. It appears infinitely easier to cross at low tide.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401058870/in/set-72157645539710311" title="The narrow river crossing at low tide by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2933/14401058870_d1730cc65d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The narrow river crossing at low tide" class="img-responsive"><em>The narrow river crossing at low tide</em></a></span></p>

<p>I walked on along the path a bit further to investigate any other possible river
crossings but I didn&#8217;t find any. Eventually I came to a fork for the Corcovado
trail, the long loop. I know it is the long loop because I have a photo of the
map on my phone.</p>

<p>I decided to head up there, and quickly find it becomes a very steep, uphill
trail, and not very worn. There&#8217;s lots of leaves on the ground that don&#8217;t look
like they&#8217;ve had much foot traffic on them so I figure people don&#8217;t go that way
very often. I hope that maybe more animals hang out there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401173659/in/set-72157645539710311" title="The trail of death by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2919/14401173659_28790d21ab_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The trail of death" class="img-responsive"><em>The trail of death</em></a></span></p>

<p>I managed see some monkeys up in the trees, but they&#8217;re pretty far away and fast
moving but I tried to keep up with them along the path for a while before they
eventually disappear.</p>

<p>At this stage the path is almost non existent and heading downhill, but there
are ribbon markers tied to trees every so often to mark the trail. I venture on,
losing the path a few times but eventually seeing another marker ribbon and
continuing on. Thankfully somewhere around here I pulled out my phone to have a
look on the GPS just where I was. No signal but the maps are cached at least.
More on that later.</p>

<p>I come to a place with two markers right next to one another but no obvious path
onward. I push on a bit and find one more marker, but from there I can not find
another one. I give up and decide to just  go back before I get lost.</p>

<p>I find my way back to the two markers next to one another, but can not see the
path back from there. I stumble back up the hill a bit, but there are spider
webs everywhere which means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I have to walk through icky spider webs</li>
  <li>This definitely isn&#8217;t the way I came</li>
</ol>

<p>I really start to panic quite a lot that I&#8217;m lost and no one knows where I am.
Way to go genius! This is how it feels to be that guy from the article in the
newspaper who stupidly died lost, alone in the forest.</p>

<p>I blow the whistle on the strap of my bag as hard as I can. Nobody hears it.</p>

<p>In the stupidity that you get in a state of panic, I run up the hill in the hope
the path will somehow reappear. It doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I start to feel pretty hopeless about ever finding the path. I think that maybe
I will have to to have to make my own path back towards the beach and hope for
the best.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14401124590/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Life saving iPhone screenshot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3879/14401124590_46ba23e470_c.jpg" width="451" height="800" alt="Life saving iPhone screenshot" class="img-responsive"><em>Life saving iPhone screenshot</em></a></span></p>

<p>I pull out my iPhone and use the compass to find where I think the direction of
the beach is. It seems to be 90º from where I thought I came from, but using the
iPhone makes me realise I&#8217;d looked at the map on it earlier in the hike, so
there&#8217;s a GPS dot on there that is definitely on the path. I open Google maps
and quickly drop a map marker before the location updates so I know where I was
earlier. It confirms that up the hill is the way I need to go, so I trudge up
there, still without any sign of markers or any path. It is very very steep, not
an easy climb at all.</p>

<p>After 10 minutes of stumbling up the steep hill I&#8217;m getting close to the map
marker and I suddenly I come across something that looks like the path. The
immense relief that washes over me is indescribable.</p>

<p>I backtrack back to the fork where I chose the long loop, and continue round the
other loop back to camp and decide I&#8217;m done with hiking for the day. Heck, I was
done for the month, but I still had the 20km hike back out of the park ahead of
me.</p>

<p>I have another shower in my clothes, hang my shirt out to dry, and then rest in
the shade of the base camp building, and eat some food and read all afternoon. I
actually ended up finishing a full book that afternoon; something I haven&#8217;t done
in years.</p>

<p>The next day I woke up nice and early to pack down my tent and get a head start
before the heat really started.</p>

<p>When I got to the river it was was at a much lower tide this time. I still hang
around next to the river and wait on someone else to cross first, so there&#8217;s at
least someone around if I get swept out to sea. The water is only to my knees
this time, but the current is strong enough to knock you down if you lost your
footing. Lots of baby steps.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14612415013/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Shipwreck? by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3917/14612415013_1485f19c06_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Shipwreck?" class="img-responsive"><em>Shipwreck?</em></a></span></p>

<p>The walk back is pretty long and uneventful. I unintentionally take an alternate
route for part of the walk that goes by what looks like both some old rusted
mining equipment in the sea, and the remains of a long-ago rusted-away
shipwreck, evidence of a large winch and drive shaft and lots of rusted sheet
metal.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14405726068/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Taipir foot prints near the ocean by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2921/14405726068_639dd3056f_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Taipir foot prints near the ocean" class="img-responsive"><em>Taipir foot prints near the ocean</em></a></span></p>

<p>I saw some really big foot prints on the beach, that I thought might be a big
cat, but identifying them against the chart at the last ranger station I think
they were the prints of a tapir.</p>

<p>I also saw a Tayra, a black cat like animal with a bears head, wandering along
with something in its mouth. I was much too slow to get my camera to get a photo
though.</p>

<p>I made it back to the bus station in 5.5 hours, nearly half the amount of time
it took to get in. It was far less stressful and there was far less fucking
about doing it solo.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14405866068/in/set-72157645539710311" title="Wild macaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5559/14405866068_5d27d7fe0c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wild macaw" class="img-responsive"><em>Wild macaw</em></a></span></p>

<p>At the bus station I had a beer, and met the very unpleasant Canadian ex-pat
owner of the store there. He had a whinge at me about my taking off my shoes to
try and dry out my sweat waterlogged feet. Then complained that the locals were
all filthy and never washed their hands. He just generally whinged a lot, even
more than I have in this blog post, and that&#8217;s a fair bit.</p>

<p>He said he&#8217;s lived there for 25 years, right on the edge of the park, but he
says that only been into the park once. He claims to have seen all the big cats,
and that because of that there&#8217;s no point going into the park. I could not wait
to get away from the guy.</p>

<p>I ended up getting a lift back to town with a Swedish couple, Carolyn and
Niklas, who had a guide and so weren&#8217;t stuck waiting for the buses last in the
afternoon. They were a really nice couple and I can&#8217;t thank them enough for
rescuing me from the whinger at the shop.</p>

<p>The shower when I get back to the hotel is the greatest moment in anyone&#8217;s life
ever. Being clean and not drenched in sweat is extremely novel and enjoyable.</p>

<p>I spent the evening hanging out drinking beers with Carolyn and Niklas, The
perfect way to celebrate not having died alone in the dense Costa Rican jungle!</p>

<p>Poi Love Camp was an 11 day retreat focused on becoming better poi spinners,
held in Costa Rica, and run by Nick Woolsey, the man behind
<a href="http://www.playpoi.com">PlayPoi</a>. Also teaching there was one of the spinners
who has inspired me the most: Jonathan Alvarez, and also the mind-bendingly
talented Alien Jon.</p>

<p>The retreat had been on my radar for a little while, but it wasn&#8217;t until a few
days before Christmas when I decided that I really wanted to get out of the
European winter that I started seriously thought about going. A day later I had
bought flights and tickets to what ended up being one of the most fun fortnights
I&#8217;ve ever had. Impulsive travel planning at it&#8217;s best.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14349420794/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Finca Mia by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3865/14349420794_0733e78d5a_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Finca Mia" class="img-responsive"><em>Finca Mia</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was held at a property right next to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Chirrip%C3%B3">Cerro
Chirripó</a> called Finca Mia, a
beautiful eco-retreat up in the hills, with a pretty little river running
through the property.</p>

<p>Just about everyone attending stayed at the same hotel in San Jose for a night
on arrival, so we could all get driven out to the site together in a minivan the
next day. It was astonishing cool to come down for breakfast and find Nick,
Jonathan and Jon all seated around a table talking about poi. The guys from the
videos you&#8217;ve watched over and over, trying to work out what sort of voodoo
they&#8217;re using to pull off tricks that appear to defy physics, now right there in
front of you, and you&#8217;re eating breakfast with them. I was actually kind of star
struck for most of the first day and felt too intimated to actually even spin in
front of those guys.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14163597899/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Pool time, sunscreening up my head by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2902/14163597899_980c379513_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Pool time, sunscreening up my head" class="img-responsive"><em>Pool time, sunscreening up my head</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was some pool side video making in the morning with Nick and Jonathan
trying to spin underwater, and general mingling and getting to meet everyone
there.</p>

<p>The minivan ride was lots of fun, everyone discussing how they got started
spinning, how long they&#8217;d been doing it etc. There were some great stories told,
but I think Jonathan&#8217;s story telling abilities deserve a special mention, he&#8217;s
nearly as good at story telling as he is at poi. But stories told at Poi Love
Camp, stay at Poi Love Camp :P</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14327145806/in/set-72157645015360162" title="ATM Pitstop means it's time to spin by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2900/14327145806_09a86953dc_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="ATM Pitstop means it's time to spin" class="img-responsive"><em>ATM Pitstop means it&#8217;s time to spin</em></a></span></p>

<p>Every time the van would stop for any reason, people would jump out and start
spinning, to the amusement/confusion of the local Ticos, many of who&#8217;d never
seen anything like it.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Finca Mia I got lucky and ended up with a cabin to myself
called the sunrise cabin. It only had 3 walls and a curtain for the fourth wall,
facing the direction that the sun rises. It was kind of surreal having a room
that just opened straight out into the forest!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14327238376/in/set-72157645015360162" title="My cabin from below by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5514/14327238376_e163a315b8_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="My cabin from below" class="img-responsive"><em>My cabin from below</em></a></span></p>

<p>As the sun set that first evening, loads and loads of fireflies started to
appear; at first I wasn&#8217;t sure it wasnt just that thing where skin cells in your
eyes float around and sparkle, but I got up close to one with a light and saw it
really was a glowing little bug. They made the place feel like a some sort of
magical pixi-land with little glowing dots all along the pathways. There was
actually quite a lot of wild life on the property, loads of lizards,
hummingbirds, even an armadillo that came stumbling through on occasion!</p>

<p>It was really lovely getting to get to know everyone at camp. Everybody was very
friendly and approachable and after a few days it felt like I&#8217;d known these
people for a whole lot longer than I had.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14163685890/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Looking in to the yoga deck by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3902/14163685890_65c2b86dab_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Looking in to the yoga deck from the balcony" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking in to the yoga deck from the balcony</em></a></span></p>

<p>Days largely consisted of yoga first thing in the morning, followed by a very
varied and delicious organic breakfast and some time to relax or go for a quick
swim. I stuck it out with the yoga for about a week before giving in and coming
to terms that my calves and hamstrings have become way too tight for most of the
poses these days. One day I&#8217;ll have to really focus on getting some of the
flexibility back I lost while I was injured, but attempting poses way beyond my
limits isn&#8217;t the right path to that.</p>

<p>A bit later we&#8217;d spend a few hours leading up to lunch back up on the yoga deck
working on various poi skills with a big focus on getting the basics super
solid, various methods of counting/timing to fit better with music, performance
and choreography.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14346986521/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Poiruvian man synchro by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5155/14346986521_f9e1a71ab8_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Poiruvian man synchro" class="img-responsive"><em>Poiruvian man synchro</em></a></span></p>

<p>Lunch would be another healthy buffet of amazing food, followed by a bit more
free time in which I often took the chance to swim in the river. The water was a
little bit fresh but very refreshing when you&#8217;re all hot and sweaty from the
mornings activities, and it was lovely to warm up in the sun on the rocks
afterwards.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14163690908/in/set-72157645015360162" title="The river by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2924/14163690908_39c20c6aa1_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The river" class="img-responsive"><em>The river</em></a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoons we&#8217;d head back up to the yoga deck for more workshops, often
building on the stuff from the morning, or practicing a choreographed piece that
Nick had us working towards to film for a video.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14327155646/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Classes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5197/14327155646_5fd1d8a550_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Learning choreography" class="img-responsive"><em>Learning choreography</em></a></span></p>

<p>Dinner would be another organic feast. One night we had some soft-shell tacos
and they were pretty much the best tacos I&#8217;ve ever tasted!</p>

<p>I learned loads of stuff in a short period, and became aware of a number of weak
spots in my basic skills that I needed to work on. I&#8217;ve previously learned a lot
things only in anti-clockwise, so while I can do a lot of different things I&#8217;m
often limited in what I can move between seamlessly because I&#8217;m not comfortable
with the direction required to do so. It&#8217;s good to have realised that it&#8217;s a
problem so I can go back and focus on the basics for all the different
permutations to make everything flow together a little more easily.</p>

<p>We did some good exercises about developing left/right independence. Sort of
like the old rubbing-your-tummy-while-patting-your-head, but on steroids. It&#8217;s
actually kind of funny to see how badly behaved my left hand can be when I&#8217;m
doing something else with my right. Either hand can do it&#8217;s part separately
easily, but combined the left just falls apart. These skills become really
important for Hybrids where one hand traces out one pattern while the other
traces out a completely different one, creating some very beautiful
combinations.</p>

<p>A lot of time was spent on footwork techniques to turn more smoothly and with
less effort, and spotting while turning to reduce dizziness when repeatedly
turning in the same direction. This seems to be stuff that people with a dance
background have very little trouble with but having never really learnt to dance
I found quite difficult. Thankfully a little bit of practice has improved things
a lot but I still need to work on this a lot.</p>

<p>We did some work on counting different parts of motion in order to fit patterns
to music better. Counting downbeats feels really natural to most people, but
doing so means that most patterns repeat on an odd number, which when put to 4/4
music makes things complicated. For something simple like a 3-beat weave, you&#8217;re
stuck repeating it 4 times over 3 bars of music before things line up again.</p>

<p>While I can follow the theory about this stuff, I struggled really hard to
actually find the beat a lot of the time. I know people joke about having no
rhythm, but it honestly feels like the part of my brain that should help with
this is seriously underdeveloped.</p>

<p>Nick had a set of <a href="http://lighttoys.pyroterra.cz/visual-poi-staff-v3/">Pyroterra Visual
Poi</a> at the retreat which he
was kind enough to let me have a go of. From the first time I saw these on a
video on Youtube I&#8217;ve been in awe, and then when I saw the $1500 price I was in
even more awe. Getting to actually spin them was amazingly, fun and kind of
disorienting (they&#8217;re super bright), but also kind of terrifying. I&#8217;m sure
they&#8217;re probably pretty tough, but the though of having to pay for them if they
got broken meant I was probably more worried spinning them than I&#8217;ve ever been
with fire.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rXfYzFGL99Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>Jon and Jonathan brought along a lot of (at the time) not-yet-for-sale Flowtoys
products which we all got to play around with. Lots of stuff from the new
modular capsule line-up, capsule handles, compact capsule flower-cap poi, dual
capsule tube poi, even capsule staffs! The capsule handles are so nice I&#8217;m
pretty much converted to the idea of lit up handles, and I really liked the
compact flower-cap poi.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14350320165/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Hot springs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5571/14350320165_c6a9d0c105_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Hot springs" class="img-responsive"><em>Hot springs</em></a></span></p>

<p>We made a couple of excursions out into the local area. One day we made a visit
to the nearby hot springs. There&#8217;s natural warm water coming down the hill, but
it&#8217;s been routed into some concrete pools to make the bodies of water big enough
to really swim it. It was a very relaxing way to spend a few hours just hanging
out enjoying the water.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="1280" height="720" src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com//www.youtube.com/embed/DPQi4KNHonM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>We got invited to come along to a local festival and rodeo where the group
performed in the bull ring with LED poi. The PA did not have any way to connect
an iPod so we ended up spinning to their selection of music, some Latin-American
pop music songs from the charts. The crowd loved it and some people were even
actually asking afterwards about getting the group to perform at other events.
It was my first time in front of a big crowd and it was heaps of fun.</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6n_n9iDN5Do?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>After the performance Jonathan decided he wanted to spin poi in the ring with
the bulls. The locals weren&#8217;t so keen on him doing this, but they he was able to
partner up with a local guy who was shitfaced drunk, and tried to tie up a baby
bull. The guy had somehow miscommunicated that Jonathan should try and tie up
the bull&#8217;s back legs up while the local guy grabbed it around the neck, which
lead to some hilarious attempts to get it tied up while the announcer heckled
him in Spanish.</p>

<p>One morning some of us made a visit to the local chocolate maker in the village.
It was run by a lady named Tao, who showed us how they made their chocolate,
grinding the cocoa beans in a juicer with some cocoa butter, then put in a
conching machine that rolled the chocolate over for 3 days to get it silky
smooth. We then got to take a batch from 3 days ago and make our own blocks of
chocolate with our own choice of added flavourings.  I made mine with crushed
coffee beans, chilli flakes and sea salt. It turned out really tasty and didn&#8217;t
last long after I started eating it.</p>

<p>Another day the whole group took a trip to a nearby beach for the day, Playa
Dominical. We had a nice lunch when we arrived, then went out in the surf and
did some body surfing. It was incredibly fun and reminded me how much I enjoy the
ocean. We had our afternoon poi class by the shore, then had dinner at a local
restaurant before making the trip back to the finca.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14350077512/in/set-72157645015360162" title="Nick spinning by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5545/14350077512_559e9d5538_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Nick spinning" class="img-responsive"><em>Nick spinning</em></a></span></p>

<p>We had two nights of spinning fire right at the end of the retreat, as we had
some issues getting our hands on suitable fuel to burn. It was the first time
I&#8217;d spun with fire since way back in Thailand, so I was a little timid about it
and only felt up to spinning the first night, but it was great to see everyone
else busting out their best performances. Especially enjoyable were Thomas
spinning like a mad man to some crazy French psy-trance, AlienJon&#8217;s
beautifully synchronized slow swinging pendulums to an Ott song, and Nick
spinning to &#8220;I&#8217;m too sexy&#8221; :P</p>

<p>After everything was done and dusted I hung around at Finca Mia for an extra few
days afterwards. It was sad to see the group diminish but great to get to spend
some extra time with the others who stayed on.</p>

<p>For Christmas 2013, My Melbourne friends Leigh and Nicolette who currently live
in Edinburgh kindly offered to have myself and our English mate Matty P come
stay with them, so I had sorted out my flight from Spain to go straight there.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><i>Side note: My apologies about the lack of photos to go with the first half of
this post, I got super slack with photography over Christmas and was having too
much fun with friends.</i></p>

<p>On arrival I had a minor freak out where my bag hadn&#8217;t come out at baggage
collection, which contained pretty much all of my warm clothes. Thoughts of
spending Christmas day in Scotland in shorts and a T-shirt went through my head.
It turned out there were about 10 other people with the same issue, and what has
happened was that one bag had gotten stuck on the other side of the conveyor
belt and knocked a dozen bags off out the back.</p>

<p>I got rugged up and then got the bus into the city to meet up with Leigh and
Nicolette, and their reaction on my arrival about my giant moustache was just
the kind I was hoping, awe and disbelief.</p>

<p>We got another bus out to their place at Leith to drop off my bags, then headed
out to have dinner at a nice pub nearby their house. The place made a great
rabbit burger, and we caught up and talked about past and future travel plans.</p>

<p>Leigh had to work the next day, Christmas eve, so Nic and I hung out for the day
and got things together for the Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>We were actually house sitting for Nic&#8217;s workmate Dave, so we took my bags with
us and dropped them off at their office, then went out and had an amazing
Scottish breakfast for just £4. It had everything; bacon, eggs, flat sausage,
round sausages, black pudding, beans. So unhealthy yet so very delicious.</p>

<p>We went down the street to the nearby Lidl and shopped for some pork to roast
and some veggies, and some bacon and eggs to make for  breakfast, then ducked
down to a big off licence to stock up on what seemed like plenty of beers.</p>

<p>We took it all back to the office and hung out there cutting out letters for a
very sweet video Nicolette put together for Leigh, and waiting for Dave to
finish at work so he could take us to his place before heading off to visit his
family.</p>

<p>Dave had kindly stocked his fridge with beers for us as well, and with bacon and
eggs and all sort of other good easy to prepare foods, so we definitely weren&#8217;t
going to be going thirsty or hungry.</p>

<p>Leigh arrived back from work and we cracked open some drinks and watched some
stuff on Netflix and kicked back. A bit later in the evening Matty P arrived,
who also had to work Christmas eve and then drive all the way up from
Nottingham. It was great to have everyone together in one place again.</p>

<p>The good times continued and we all stayed up until 4am, drinking beer, talking
shit and watching shows.</p>

<p>We woke up fairly late Christmas day, feeling pretty rough, but after a few
drinks our hangovers disappeared. We actually ran out of beer, even though it
felt like we had more there than we could possibly drink, but a nearby store was
open and we solved that problem pretty easily.</p>

<p>We prepared the pork roast and the veggies and put them in the oven, and we
rewarded a few hours later with a very delicious Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>On boxing day we finally made some use of the breakfast food we&#8217;d purchased and
made a feast of bacon, both kinds of sausage, eggs, bacon and beans. Epic as
always.</p>

<p>We cleaned up Dave&#8217;s place to leave it as we found it, then went out looking for
a pub where we could get haggis, neaps and tatties for a late lunch, to make
sure we ticked all of the boxes for a visit to Scotland.</p>

<p>We found a great place that had movie theatre seats with the names of all the
characters from train spotting and I got my haggis fix with a couple of nice
ales.</p>

<p>Matty let slip that he&#8217;d never been to Edinburgh before so we all decided we
should get a bus over to the royal mile, the street that leads up to Edinburgh
castle and have a walk around.</p>

<p>It was very pretty up there, but icy cold winds were blowing through, so we went
down the other side of the hill to the Grassmarket and had a beer in the oldest
pub in Edinburgh (Maybe even all of Scotland?). We had a look at a few other
pubs along the same strip before heading back to the house.</p>

<p>Matty offered that I could come back to Nottingham with him for NYE, and after
looking at the ludicrous prices of hostels in Edinburgh over that period it was
the only sensible choice. Places were asking £60-70 a night for a bed in a 16
person dorm. Fucking crazy!</p>

<p>Anyway, we said our goodbyes to Nicolette and Leigh and then set off on the
long drive from Edinburgh to Nottingham, 4-5 hours finally arriving at 1:30am.
It felt nice to be back at my home away from home again.</p>

<p>Between Christmas and New Years I spent a lot of time hacking on my blog,
dumping Tumblr as a platform because it didn&#8217;t fit well with my
not-always-online work flow.</p>

<p>We also revisited a few of my favourite bars around town, the Canal House and
Brewdog being the primary haunts, trying all the new ales they now had on tap.</p>

<p>For my birthday, New Years Eve, we got some tickets to go and see a chap-hop
rapper, Professor Elemental. For those who&#8217;ve never heard of chap-hop, it&#8217;s a
hilarious genre of hip-hop performed by very proper, steam-punk-esk British
gentlemen, rapping about important things like tea, being British and fighting
trousers. Here&#8217;s a video clip to give you an idea of what it&#8217;s like:</p>

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eELH0ivexKA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>The night has a fancy dress steam punk theme, which made my moustache very well
received. I even had a few people so impressed that they were buying me drinks.
Sadly it didn&#8217;t seem to provoke such a positive response from the ladies :P</p>

<p>I got a chance to actually meet Professor Elemental before he was on, who said
that he was well jealous of the moustache and I got a few photos of us together.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14316422983/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Me and Professor Elemental by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5502/14316422983_7750822a98_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Me and Professor Elemental" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and Professor Elemental</em></a></span></p>

<p>His set was great, everyone was getting right into it and I even got name
checked during it. It was a really fun night and it was a great way to spend my
birthday.</p>

<p>A few days later on the weekend, Matty got a vehicle from work and we went on a
trip to see Bletchley Park, to top secret facility where they were cracking the
enigma codes during World War II.</p>

<p>We saw a bunch of enigma encryption devices and learnt a bit about how the work.
They have various code wheels that are each electrically wired differently, and
each have a number of modes, each set to a different letter, so that the input
letter undergoes many mutations. There was something like 80 million possible
ciphers for some of the devices, and they would change them every single day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14316430763/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Turing Bombe Rebuild Project by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3698/14316430763_46976068bc_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Turing Bombe Rebuild Project" class="img-responsive"><em>Turing Bombe Rebuild Project</em></a></span></p>

<p>The enigma devices were incredibly impressive themselves at the time, but then
the ‘bombe&#8217; code cracking devices used to mechanically switch through 30-40 full
sets of enigma code wheels simultaneously, searching for configurations that
were electrically complete were simply mind blowing. The machine would stop when
set of code wheels lined up in an electrically complete manner, and then that
configuration would be tested against a German message to see if it was the
correct code for the day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109710727/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Opened Bombe by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3782/14109710727_a5baf3021b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Opened Bombe" class="img-responsive"><em>Opened Bombe</em></a></span></p>

<p>We even got to see a demonstration of their bombe recreation working, it was
quite a noisy sight to see.</p>

<p>There was some stories about several spies and double agents who were feeding
misinformation to the German secret service; some real James Bond style stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109701527/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Alan Turing statue by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3817/14109701527_66e8df2c80_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Alan Turing statue" class="img-responsive"><em>Alan Turing statue</em></a></span></p>

<p>They have a nice statue to Alan Turing, along with a copy of the British apology
for his treatment for being gay.</p>

<p>We ducked across to the nearby computer history museum to have a look around
there as well. They have a recreation of Colossus, the world&#8217;s first electronic
digital computer that was at all programmable. It was mammoth in size and crazy
noisy.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109618058/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Colossus recreation by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3689/14109618058_30802e5a5f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Colossus recreation" class="img-responsive"><em>Colossus recreation</em></a></span></p>

<p>They had a working PDP-11, complete with text adventure game, but sadly it
wasn&#8217;t powered up that afternoon. The thing was as big as 4-5 full height server
racks.</p>

<p>Another room had the oldest still functioning computer, buzzing away playing the
Monty Python theme music. So British!</p>

<p>They also had some other massive old computers, literally the size of a room !
You could actually hear them humming and processing as text would appear appear
on the screen.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14295712504/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Those are some big disks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3699/14295712504_df5c5d95d6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Those are some big disks" class="img-responsive"><em>Those are some big disks</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another interesting piece that had was the longest continuously functioning
computer, retired in the mid 2000s from a power plant. It had worked there for
something like 40 years straight without ever being restarted.</p>

<p>It was an awesome day out and I&#8217;m glad Matt kept suggesting that we should go
and do something that weekend. I had been not really looking for things I wanted
to do around England as I didn&#8217;t want to be a burden on Matt who already works
way too hard during the week. I realised though that Matt wanting to go do stuff
isn&#8217;t just about him trying to entertain his guest; it&#8217;s giving him a chance to
do stuff he wouldn&#8217;t go and do by himself, which I can relate to when I&#8217;m at
home.</p>

<p>On my last night in Nottingham we went out to the Linconshire Poacher for dinner
and I had a very tasty game meat casserole and a few nice ales to wash it down.
We finished off the night at Brewdog, going on a bit of a dark beer rampage,
trying their tactical nuclear penguin, dogma, espresso psycho and their
shipwrecker circus, all of which were amazing, and are often very difficult to
find beers.</p>

<p>The next day I woke up extremely hungover and unwell, but I had a train to
London to catch so I headed off to the station and caught my train. The train
felt fairly quick, even with me feeling nauseated at times, but I made it to
London OK and went and checked into my hostel and tried to sleep off the
hangover.</p>

<p>In the evening I went for a bit of a walk around London, from Charring Cross,
around Reagent Street to Piccadilly Circus and Soho, through China town and the
West End.</p>

<p>I made a visit to M&amp;M world, several floors packed with nothing but M&amp;Ms and M&amp;M
branded products. They had a rainbow of tubes full of M&amp;Ms which you could buy
as single colours or make your own mixes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14296293235/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Rainbow of M&amp;Ms by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2927/14296293235_48dac64c3c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rainbow of M&amp;Ms" class="img-responsive"><em>Rainbow of M&amp;Ms</em></a></span></p>

<p>I was woken up at 6:30am the next day by a real fire alarm evacuation, which had
everyone in the hostel out standing on the street in the freezing cold morning.
Some people had gone out barefoot without a jacket, which would have been hell.
It wasnt a very pleasant start to the day but I figured I&#8217;d take advantage of it
and didn&#8217;t go back to bed.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14273158356/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Firetruck outside the hotel, way too early in the morning by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3673/14273158356_66654fa019_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Firetruck outside the hotel, way too early in the morning" class="img-responsive"><em>Firetruck outside the hotel, way too early in the morning</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent the morning going around to a bunch of camera shops, having a look at
various models of pocketable cameras that still have a good amount of manual
controls, as I&#8217;d been thinking I&#8217;d like a smaller camera for my travels. Nothing
I saw had the features I&#8217;d like at a price I was happy to pay so I&#8217;m still using
my trusty GX1 to this day.</p>

<p>Later I went to Notting Hill to meet up with a guy from couchsurfing who had
organised a juggle jam there. On my way there I passed some cool markets along
Portobello road and even stumbled upon a Banksy piece.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109655028/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Banksy by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5536/14109655028_7ac2290690_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Banksy" class="img-responsive"><em>Banksy</em></a></span></p>

<p>It ended up just being the two of us there, but it was good to get in some
juggling practice and spend a bit of time spinning poi, and we had some
interesting conversation about how cheap it is to live on a houseboat in London
compared to a house, and these vipassana meditation retreats that he&#8217;d been on
where you&#8217;re pretty much meditating for a week, not really talking at all during
that time.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14316483513/in/set-72157644891794991" title="V &amp; A Museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3764/14316483513_39938d832d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="V &amp; A Museum" class="img-responsive"><em>V &amp; A Museum</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went to the Victoria &amp; Albert museum and had a quick run through as I&#8217;d heard
it was supposed to be amazing. I didn&#8217;t actually find the place very
interesting, although there were some impressive rooms in the building itself.</p>

<p>I ducked across from there and went back to the science museum. I saw lots of
medical related sections, and the history of medicine, but I ran out of time and
it closed before I was done AGAIN!</p>

<p>The next day I wandered around Camden markets some more, admiring all the
amazingly detailed steampunk style clothes they have. I&#8217;d really love to have an
outfit like that for dress ups at festivals but I&#8217;m not really in a position for
that right now.</p>

<p>I met up for dinner with my English friend Andrew, and Jarod,an Aussie mate who&#8217;s
working over in London at the moment.</p>

<p>We went out for dumplings at a place called Ping Pong Dim Sum. It was good to
catch up and the food was top notch, but OMG was it a lot more expensive than I
ever thought possible. £30 each! For dumplings!</p>

<p>I had a quite day starting with a long breakfast at a nice place called the
Inhibition cafe in Camden, then spent time catching up on my blog and watching
the new episode of Sherlock.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14273176316/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Me and a rare, sadly empty bottle of sink the bismark by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3755/14273176316_349a091396_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Me and a rare, sadly empty bottle of sink the bismark" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and a rare, sadly empty bottle of sink the bismark</em></a></span></p>

<p>I  the evening I went over to Brewdog Camden for a few quiet drinks, and got
talking with a few off-duty staff and the manager in one corner of the bar. I
ended up getting shouted a bunch of really nice barley wines by them. I recall
Evil Twin Brewing - Torst Front room being particularly delicious.</p>

<p>A night on the barely wine means a morning of feeling pretty awful, but a quick
trip back to the Inhibition cafe got my grease and fat levels up to a suitable
point for dealing with the hangover.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14292977201/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Epic face by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5313/14292977201_22b7622eae_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Epic face" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic face</em></a></span></p>

<p>I wandered through the back streets around behind Camden markets, taking some
photos of street art, and decided to hunt out more graffiti around London. I
headed over to Shoredich and spent the rest of the day being wowed by some of
the very creative pieces around in that part of the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109809537/in/set-72157644891794991" title="Off duty palace guard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3723/14109809537_ebf7ed43f4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Off duty palace guard" class="img-responsive"><em>Off duty palace guard</em></a></span></p>

<p>My last day in the UK I went and searched for an open op shop to donate back my
winter coat and unneeded jeans, but a lot of them don&#8217;t open at all on a Sunday
and those that do open quite late, so it turned out a lot more difficult than I
had expected but I got it done in the end.</p>

<p>After finding an American style cafe and having a nice bowl of chilli and a
chocolate and peanut butter milkshake for lunch, I took the tube out to Heathrow
to get my flight to the warm lands of Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Next stop in Andalusia was a town named Córdoba that&#8217;s claim to fame is the
Mezquita, a Mosque-Cathedral. I arrived in the evening and explored around a
bit, finding the town to be almost completely deserted but did take some nice
photos of this Roman era bridge and tower.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The Internet tells you you should try and get to the Mezquita early in the
morning so you can get photos without all the crowds, but the Internet doesn&#8217;t
factor in not being able to get to sleep until 5am in the morning, so I instead
got up around noon and went and had lunch for breakfast, a dish with ox tail
that was extremely nice.</p>

<p>After I&#8217;d eaten I headed over to the courtyard outside the Mezquita, a huge open
space full of orange trees. In fact, all of Córdoba is pretty well decked out in
orange trees; they seem to be a very common decorative plant in Andalusia.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919408747/in/set-72157644463351646" title="The court of oranges by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2916/13919408747_13be1c076f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The court of oranges" class="img-responsive"><em>The court of oranges</em></a></span></p>

<p>I actually peeled one and tried it, and let me tell you: it tasted terrible.
The oranges on these trees are incredibly bitter and unpleasant. I asked someone
about it later to find out if maybe they just weren&#8217;t ripe yet, but it turns out
they&#8217;re just not the eating kind. I didn&#8217;t even know there were not-eating
oranges. That person thought they might even be toxic to humans, so it&#8217;s lucky
they taste awful enough that I spat out my first bite.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919504160/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Beautiful archway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2903/13919504160_495eca2d16_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Beautiful archway" class="img-responsive"><em>Beautiful archway</em></a></span></p>

<p>Anyhow, I paid my admission and went into the Mezquita and it seemed that
afternoon was the perfect time for a visit. The place was nearly deserted,
giving me a chance to get a bunch of &#8220;postcard&#8221; shots without tour groups
cluttering them up.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14106540995/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Endless arches by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2915/14106540995_369781e1f5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Endless arches" class="img-responsive"><em>Endless arches</em></a></span></p>

<p>The building is absolutely massive, probably 150-200 Meters long and the same
again wide, and decked out with hundreds of columns, all topped with candy cane
coloured arches. It&#8217;s very picturesque!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14083005976/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally. by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7304/14083005976_3ac0d2bd9a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally." class="img-responsive"><em>Pretty patterns. and Jesus on a cross, naturally.</em></a></span></p>

<p>The building was actually originally built as a mosque, and is apparently
regarded as one of the most accomplished monuments of Moorish architecture.
Córdoba was later captured from the Moors by a Catholic king so the building was
converted into a Catholic cathedral, adding many Christian features to the
building and converting the minaret into a bell tower.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919575399/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Giant renaissance cathedral nave by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7302/13919575399_bf03ff09f1_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Giant renaissance cathedral nave" class="img-responsive"><em>Giant renaissance cathedral nave</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was also this epic double organ with things up either side of the nave
(let&#8217;s hope I&#8217;m using that word right, I saw it on Wikipedia but didn&#8217;t care
enough to actually read the article), with pipes jutting out that made me think
of crazy drag-racing car exhausts.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919678087/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Organ pipes by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2916/13919678087_789b8871e3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Organ pipes" class="img-responsive"><em>Organ pipes</em></a></span></p>

<p>After I&#8217;d taken 50 billion photos of arches I started playing around with my
camera settings and super long exposure shots to let me get some low ISO photos
with the fairly low lighting. A tripod would have been awesome, but I don&#8217;t own
one and they specifically disallow them there, so I made do with putting the
camera on various ledges.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14083226416/in/set-72157644463351646" title="I'm a ghost! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2913/14083226416_b46cff9418_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="I'm a ghost!" class="img-responsive"><em>I&#8217;m a ghost!</em></a></span></p>

<p>After doing a few I had the idea of running into the shot part way through the
exposure and standing still like a stature to try and get a transparent
ghost-like effect.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13919732469/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Double ghost! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5555/13919732469_29bbd66bbb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Double ghost!" class="img-responsive"><em>Double ghost!</em></a></span></p>

<p>I then tried doing even longer exposure shots and running around stopping in multiple
places so I could be in the same photo two or more times, no Photoshop required!</p>

<p>I probably ended up spending more time messing around with crazy ideas for
photos than I did actually looking around the Mezquita. I had heaps of fun
figuring out what worked, and I think some of them turned out pretty awesome if
I do say so myself.</p>

<p>After Córdoba I got one of the speedy Renfe trains to Seville. A little digital
display in the train told me we were going 250km/hour, but it was still
wonderfully smooth and quite the whole time. I wish we had decent trains back
home in Australia.</p>

<p>I went on yet another free walking tour, led by a student from Columbia. The
tour itself was alright, but everyone on the tour seemed to be travelling in
groups of 2-4 and there wasn&#8217;t much inter-mingling so it didn&#8217;t feel very social
compared to some of the tours that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed.</p>

<p>I had heard from <a href="http://herecomestheplanet.com">Amanda and Luke</a> that Seville doesn&#8217;t
really live up to it&#8217;s reputation and I have to agree. Nothing we visited on the
tour really stood out for me, so here&#8217;s a token photo of Plaza de España with
all the water drained out.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921314810/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Plaza de Espa&#xF1;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7413/13921314810_d89de7e826_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Plaza de Espa&#xF1;a" class="img-responsive"><em>Plaza de Espa&#xF1;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>They did however recommend a fancy tapas place called <a href="http://laazoteasevilla.es/">La
Azotea</a> which was absolutely fantastic. I had some
smoked cheese, cooked wild mushrooms, and pork cheek; and all of it was amazing.
It was hands down the nicest tapas I came across; so good that I came back again
for dinner the same day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14jk128073893/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7039/14128073893_295d0227fd_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Intricate carved archway in the Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville" class="img-responsive"><em>Intricate carved archway in the Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville</em></a></span></p>

<p>I did get a tip from the tour guide that if I only visited once place, that the
Alcázar should be it, so after some difficulty actually locating it (Seville is
like a maze in the old part of the city) I checked it out.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14084997556/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5231/14084997556_dd797d2f95_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville" class="img-responsive"><em>Alc&#xE1;zar of Seville</em></a></span></p>

<p>The Alcázar is a stunning building and a royal palace. It has been added to by
each of the monarchs who have occupied it leading to a mix of a lot of different
styles from a lot of different periods in time.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14105067702/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Golden dome ceiling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7189/14105067702_14497fe666_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Golden dome ceiling" class="img-responsive"><em>Golden dome ceiling</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m really starting to appreciate the Moorish style of decoration, where because
their religion prohibits them from creating a likeness of things  they have lots
of intricate geometric patterns and carvings as decoration. I find it much more
visually pleasing decoration than paintings and statues.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14104838381/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Water feature by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5578/14104838381_1afea7139b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Water feature" class="img-responsive"><em>Water feature</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were lots of beautifully decorated court yards, and some huge green
gardens outside, but rain that day impeded me from exploring the external parts
of the palace very much.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14085111856/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Metropol Parasol by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5509/14085111856_b380ca185e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Metropol Parasol" class="img-responsive"><em>Metropol Parasol</em></a></span></p>

<p>In the evening I went and explored one of the stranger, modern attractions of
Seville: The Metropol Parasol. It&#8217;s a huge wooden structure, several stories
high, apparently the largest wooden structure in the world. It looks kind of
like those <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wood+dinosaur+kit&amp;tbm=isch">wooden dinosaur
kits</a> you&#8217;d beg for
at museums when you were a kid (or was that just me?), except instead of a
dinosaur they got some crazy mushroom looking thing.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921571459/in/set-72157644463351646" title="On top of the Metropol Parasol by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5465/13921571459_b78a62036f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="On top of the Metropol Parasol" class="img-responsive"><em>On top of the Metropol Parasol</em></a></span></p>

<p>At night it&#8217;s all lit up with coloured lights and looks pretty funky. You can
pay a few euro to get up on top of it and walk around the path, there&#8217;s even a
few bars up there and you get a free drink with your admission!</p>

<p>My next and final stop in Spain was in Málaga. It wasn&#8217;t a place I&#8217;d ever really
even heard of before, but I was flying out from there so I thought I&#8217;d give it
a look.</p>

<p>The hostel I stayed in had a thing running that night where you could help their
cook make paella and then get to eat it afterwards, although it ended up move
like watching the cook make it while getting to meet some other people in the
hostel: Annika, a German girl studying in Spain, Joni, a Finland guy on
holidays, and another guy from Finland who&#8217;s name I didn&#8217;t get, but who was
shit-faced drunk, quite rude, and kept mentioning how he had an alcohol problem.</p>

<p>Those of us who weren&#8217;t complete alcoholics went out for a few drinks (the
irony) after dinner and ended up in a pub trivia competition after meeting up
with a friend of Annika&#8217;s named Lilia and her brother Thomas. I don&#8217;t remember
how we went at trivia, almost certainly not well, but it was a really fun
evening out.</p>

<p>When I got back to the hostel I found another girl who was staying in my dorm
standing sort of awkwardly outside the door. Apparently the raging alcoholic was
asleep in someone else&#8217;s bed, as he&#8217;d wet his own bed and the one below it, and
quite rightly she didn&#8217;t want to be in there alone with him. The fun people you
meet in hostels! We went down to reception to see would could be done and they
very apologetically sorted us out and moved us into another room.</p>

<p>The next morning I went on yet another free walking tour which was given by an
Australian girl Natalie. It happened to be her birthday it was and it was her
first time giving a tour, so her sisters Vanessa and Shelly who were visiting
from London got us all to sing her happy birthday at the end of the tour.</p>

<p>The tour was good, went around Málaga and showed us the sites, although I was
probably a bit more interested in socialising. After not really meeting anyone
in Seville or Cordoba so it was nice to have some people to talk with.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921701700/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Wine from the barrel by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2910/13921701700_236ca21f56_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wine from the barrel" class="img-responsive"><em>Wine from the barrel</em></a></span></p>

<p>The tour visited this little tiny bar where you buy a glass of wine, straight
from the barrel. They had white wines and reds, sweet and dry; what I tried was
pretty good stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14108309865" title="Tasty deli by Lucas Parry, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7058/14108309865_01eac7f8bf_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Tasty deli" class="img-responsive"><em>Tasty deli</em></a></span></p>

<p>We also went into a market full of tasty delis, with all the olives a person
could want, unless they didn&#8217;t like olives in which case it would probably be
too many.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14128412563/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Catherdral with an unfinished tower by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7367/14128412563_57bd5ffc50_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Catherdral with an unfinished tower" class="img-responsive"><em>Catherdral with an unfinished tower</em></a></span></p>

<p>We stopped under this cathedral which was supposed to be symmetrical but they
ran out of money and never finished it, so it has only one completed tower. I
think it&#8217;s a bit more interesting this way anyway.</p>

<p>My afternoon consisted of a tapas lunch and a few beers with the Aussie girls
from the tour, then practicing spinning poi in a park for a while before going
home and having a nap. Then I went out for dinner with Annika and another girl
she&#8217;d met, Iva from Canada, at a little seafood place near the port, before
meeting up with Lilla and Thomas again for some €0.40 beers.  It&#8217;s a hard life
being a traveller sometimes. :P</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13921692457/in/set-72157644463351646" title="M&#xE1;laga by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5533/13921692457_71c44ab055_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="M&#xE1;laga" class="img-responsive"><em>M&#xE1;laga</em></a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday I made a long walk up the hill to visit the Castle of Gibralfaro,
which was thankfully mostly shaded. I arrived just after 2pm, and conveniently
for me it happened to be free after 2pm on Sundays so I got in for nothing. The
castle was pretty peaceful, and you were able to walk around the tops of many of
the walls and have a nice view over the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14105274272/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Castle wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2919/14105274272_68dd815cb4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Castle wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Castle wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>The square-ish bits at the top of the wall were topped by triangles (check out
that terminology, they don&#8217;t call me a castle-ologist for no reason!), which
someone told me is something to Moors would do to make Roman walls their more
Moorish or something.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14105301372/in/set-72157644463351646" title="*jaws music* by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5564/14105301372_4e0e7faf69_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="*jaws music*" class="img-responsive"><em>*jaws music*</em></a></span></p>

<p>The very last thing I did before leaving Spain was to hack off my 6-7 months of
beard growth off. It just felt like it was time to show the world I still had a
face under all that hair.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14105307192/in/set-72157644463351646" title="Ridiculous handlebars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7179/14105307192_6f4f4ed294_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Ridiculous handlebars" class="img-responsive"><em>Ridiculous handlebars</em></a></span></p>

<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t cut it all off right away :P I&#8217;d been working on growing out
a handlebar moustache from the beard for a few weeks and thought I&#8217;d let it
stand on it&#8217;s own for a little while, as a bit of a laugh for the friends who I
was going to spend Christmas with. I still get a smile looking at this photo,
thinking about just how over the top it is! It really felt like I was wearing a
fake moustache disguise when I first cut it back to this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>From Barcelona I caught the overnight train to Granada. It left fairly late in the
evening and arrived in Granada at about 9am the next morning. I had some sleeping
pills and slept as well as is possible on a train, but was still exhausted when
I arrived.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916722755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2900/13916722755_b4e79f4e47_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The courtyard at my hostel in Granada" class="img-responsive"><em>The courtyard at my hostel in Granada</em></a></span></p>

<p>I headed straight to a hostel that I&#8217;d looked up online beforehand and checked
that they had a bed for me. It was too early to check in but they let me lock up
my bags in their storage room and allowed me to take advantage of their
breakfast buffet.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Over breakfast I got talking with a friendly girl named Emily from Adelaide, who
convinced me to go on a free walking tour with her and her other Adelaidian friend
Connor.</p>

<p>The tour was led by a nice guy named Borja, a student who&#8217;d been living in
Granada for some time. I also met some other friendly faces on the tour, Rachael
from Chicago, and Jack from Hobart.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893631012/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Inside the Hamam by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3758/13893631012_de64238da4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Inside an old Hamam (bath-house)" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside an old Hamam (bath-house)</em></a></span></p>

<p>The tour gave us a bit of an orientation of the old part of the city, and filled
us in on a bit of the history of the city. Granada had been held by the Moors
for quite a long period of time, which is why there&#8217;s a lot of Moorish style
architecture around the city.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I learn was about the trouble that UNESCO causes for the
home owners in Granada who can&#8217;t afford to maintain their houses to the level
that UNESCO requires. This lead to huge fines and eventually having to give up
their houses to UNESCO. Apparently there is a huge proportion of abandoned
properties in the old city caused by this. It&#8217;s troublesome to think about, you
want these places looked after, but it seems cruel and wasteful to force the
owners out because they can&#8217;t afford the maintenance.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893651602/in/set-72157644104270734" title="A random courtyard our waking tour wandered into by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2933/13893651602_63856101f6_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="A random courtyard our waking tour wandered into" class="img-responsive"><em>A random courtyard our waking tour wandered into</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s quite a large number of cave house on the hill above Granada. Some of
them have been there so long that the people living in them have been given land
rights, while others are considered illegal dwellings and the police
occasionally come by and evict lots of the people.</p>

<p>Borja told us he that he&#8217;d spent some time living in a cave house at one point,
looking after it for a friend, and told us what a friendly communal vibe the
older area of caves had.</p>

<p>He also let slip that Granada gets a bit lonely for young people because it&#8217;s
such a student town.  Nobody stays for very long. Students come, they study and
then they leave so you only ever know people for a few years maximum.</p>

<p>After the tour finished up, just about everyone on the tour went and had lunch
at a tapas place, where the lunch special was €2 for a beer and your choice of 3
tapas from their huge buffet. Quite a bargain! We all organised to meet up
again later in the evening to see a gig put on by a band that Borja played in.</p>

<p>The 2-3 beers, and my tiredness from not getting good rest on the overnight train,
meant that I spent my afternoon back at the hostel and slept for a few hours.</p>

<p>When I woke up I found Em and Connor down in the common area and we headed to
the bar where the band was to play. The streets are pretty narrow and winding,
I&#8217;m sure I would never have found the place if it weren&#8217;t for Connor&#8217;s superb
navigation skills.</p>

<p>The Venue was tiny! The table in the corner we initially sat down at turned out
to double as a makeshift stage, so we shifted back a little to give the band
some room. The place felt jam packed too, although Borja later told us it gets
busier than that.  I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;d fit the people.</p>

<p>Just about everywhere in Granada does some form of tapas with your drinks. At
this place they would ask you how many drinks you&#8217;d had each time you ordered
another, and based on the number there was a certain sequence of little
delicious snacks that you&#8217;d get to accompany your beverage.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916878053/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Live music in a tiny little bar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7152/13916878053_e23947d397_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Live music in a tiny little bar" class="img-responsive"><em>Live music in a tiny little bar</em></a></span></p>

<p>The band was great, lots of good covers, and there was a nice informal feel to
things. Rachael even broke out into song at one point, and can that girl sing!
If being a chef gets old, she&#8217;s got potential to make a living from that voice.</p>

<p>The next morning I ran into Em and Connor again at breakfast and we decided to
go up to the Alhambra together. On the walk there I managed to fall up a tiny
set of two stairs, and sprained my left ring finger. ouch! :(</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916827755/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Connor &amp; Emily at the path to the Alhambra by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3816/13916827755_4ca281df1f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Connor &amp; Emily at the path to the Alhambra" class="img-responsive"><em>Connor &amp; Emily at the path to the Alhambra</em></a></span></p>

<p>We had all heard stories about how you needed to book days in advance, but we
just turned up and got lucky. We were allocated a timeslot to enter the palace
pretty much right away, so we dashed past the rest of the Alhambra grounds and
headed straight there.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917389114/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Columns and carvings by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2928/13917389114_da6a381b04_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Columns and carvings" class="img-responsive"><em>Columns and carvings</em></a></span></p>

<p>The palace was full of incredibly intricate carvings, in many place the carvings
went from the floor to the ceiling. It is hard to imagine how long it would have
taken to carve it all out with so much detail.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893897796/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Rich colours by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3749/13893897796_085e34aa23_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Rich colours" class="img-responsive"><em>Rich colours</em></a></span></p>

<p>A few parts had been restored (several hundred years ago IIRC) and still had some
paint remaining. It would have been mind blowing to see the place fully painted
back in the time it was used as a palace.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893863532/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Leave no surface uncarved by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7028/13893863532_392ee084ec_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Leave no surface uncarved" class="img-responsive"><em>Leave no surface uncarved</em></a></span></p>

<p>I learned about an interesting restoration technique from one of the info
boards, where they embed the new material used in restoration with a UV reactive
substance, so it appears plain to the naked eye but can still be obvious which
parts are truly original to the historians studying the structure.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916961855/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Beautiful patterns by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7353/13916961855_f16db6cb33_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beautiful patterns" class="img-responsive"><em>Beautiful patterns</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went through the palace at a very slow pace, and at some point Rachael had
arrived and caught up with me, and the other two had moved through much quicker
and finished well before us, so it was lucky that we&#8217;d organised to meet up
somewhere later on if we got separated.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893925392/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Round courtyard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2928/13893925392_1a7b0067cf_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Round courtyard" class="img-responsive"><em>Round courtyard</em></a></span></p>

<p>Rachael and I ended up exploring the rest of the Alhambra grounds together. We
found this huge square building that had a circular open courtyard in the
middle, and now housed some museums and art galleries that we did an obligatory
quick pass through.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917101303/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The view towards the new city by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7222/13917101303_643cec571e_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The view towards the new city" class="img-responsive"><em>The view towards the new city</em></a></span></p>

<p>We climbed up the towers next to the barracks, which gave a great view out to
the city of Granada, and an interesting aerial view of the foundations of the
barracks.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917480704/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Soldiers barracks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7295/13917480704_933abe24e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Soldiers barracks" class="img-responsive"><em>Soldiers barracks</em></a></span></p>

<p>The time I&#8217;d organised to reconvene with Connor and Emily was quickly
approaching, so it was very convenient when we ran into them again up on top of
one of the towers, and agreed to scrap that plan and organised something else.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893944911/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Waterjets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7235/13893944911_34bb93d54d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterjets" class="img-responsive"><em>Waterjets</em></a></span></p>

<p>The last part of the complex we visited was the Generalife gardens, which
featured a lot of beautiful fountains and water gardens.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893979231/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Water Stairway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7133/13893979231_d013b17942_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The Water Stairway" class="img-responsive"><em>The Water Stairway</em></a></span></p>

<p>On the little map/booklet about the Alhambra it made special mention of a
water-staircase, so Rachael and I got it into out heads it would be something
quite impressive to behold. Instead it turned out to be a pretty plain old
staircase with a little channel of water running down the hand-rail of either
side, be we made up a story about how it must of at least be special royal
water, not the regular peasant stuff they give to everyone else.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917089765/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Garden fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2932/13917089765_9f4cbb3592_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Garden fountain" class="img-responsive"><em>Garden fountain</em></a></span></p>

<p>All the walking around the Alhambra had made us a bit hungry so we sought out
somewhere to have a few beers and the free tapas they&#8217;d come with. We passed by
a lot of places that seemed a little too fancy to offer a good beer and tapas
deal, and eventually found a cute little place called Boabdil. It was a small
place down a little alleyway, off another alleyway with very utilitarian decor.
Stainless steel benches, fixed stools and bain-maries full of food. It turned out
to be a great choice, with really tasty food and the drinks were only €1.70!</p>

<p>We got a message from Em and Connor and let them know where we were, so we could
regroup and head the fountain, meeting place of the afternoon walking tour to
the caves on the hill that we wanted to do. It turned out it was being led again
by Borja, a lovely surprise. Jack was also back for more, and had apparently
been up to the Alhambra that day as well, although we somehow never crossed
paths.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917536504/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The illegal cave homes on the hill by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7366/13917536504_2e47accf22_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The illegal cave homes on the hill" class="img-responsive"><em>The illegal cave homes on the hill</em></a></span></p>

<p>The cave tour took us up the hill behind the old city, past a few nice view
points of the Alhambra and the old city itself with the sun setting behind it.
Then eventually up among the (illegal) hippy caves, of which only a few of who
have electricity via solar panels. I was surprised to find that even these caves
were a lot more established than I had been expecting when I first heard &#8220;cave
house.&#8221;</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917167763/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Now that looks like a cave home by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5163/13917167763_e40557b381_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Now that looks like a cave home" class="img-responsive"><em>Now that looks like a cave home</em></a></span></p>

<p>We went right up the top where a church (I think?) with a nice wall to sit on was built,
where we could sit and watch the sun set.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894015226/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7402/13894015226_a458e0d9de_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Jack, Rachael, Borja, Emily and Connor, watching the sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>After the sun had set we walked down the back side of the hill, via the newer,
less established area of caves. We learned that there&#8217;s an old hippy dude way
further over in the hills who&#8217;s lived there for years and runs a little tetería
there, a possible excursion for another day.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893997112/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Epic sunset by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7396/13893997112_065be83db3_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Epic sunset" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic sunset</em></a></span></p>

<p>After tour ended the group went on a little tapas crawl to various bars, in the
interest of getting a good feed and a few drinks into us. The first place served
us awesome Spanish ham, with legs of ham hung up all around the place. The
second gave us delicious cheese and more ham, so tasty that we stayed for a few
rounds.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894038541/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Flamenco show by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7389/13894038541_a0f16743cd_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Flamenco show" class="img-responsive"><em>Flamenco show</em></a></span></p>

<p>Next stop was a flamenco show at a little cave venue, for the princely sum of
€6. It was worth seeing for the sake of saying you&#8217;d done it, but it wasn&#8217;t
really something I&#8217;d seek out again. The dancing is enthusiastic but this time
around I found the singing kind of whiny and not all that enjoyable, and the
little cave/basement it was in was pretty dark and dingy.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894058432/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Lovely gardens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7074/13894058432_536c27a832_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lovely gardens" class="img-responsive"><em>Lovely gardens</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next day I went up to explore the gardens just below the Alhambra with Em,
Connor and Rachael. They were lovely and peaceful, and very well manicured.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894089151/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Having tea at Ishmael's cave teter&#xED;a by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7279/13894089151_0dac8cbf10_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Having tea at Ishmael's cave teter&#xED;a" class="img-responsive"><em>Having tea at Ishmael&#8217;s cave teter&#xED;a</em></a></span></p>

<p>After we&#8217;d finished exploring there, we decided to go and try and find the
tetería we&#8217;d been told about the evening before, run by the old hippy dude
Ismael. After stopping to ask the locals which path to take a few times we
managed to find our way around the hill to to tetería which had a stunning view.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894101056/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Fanciest tea + tapas ever! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7273/13894101056_828b2b23a1_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Fanciest tea + tapas ever!" class="img-responsive"><em>Fanciest tea + tapas ever!</em></a></span></p>

<p>We each had a tea which came out beautifully presented, each with it&#8217;s own tasty
fruit tapas sitting on top! Easily the fanciest tea I&#8217;ve ever had!</p>

<p>In the evening Em and Connor had to go and meet up with someone who was giving
them a lift to Seville, but Rachael and I went to try and find Nuestro Bar, a
place that a friend who lived here for a while had told me about that was
supposed to have really great tapas.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917211833/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Alhambra at night by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3706/13917211833_b89bf08c6d_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The Alhambra at night" class="img-responsive"><em>The Alhambra at night</em></a></span></p>

<p>After walking for what seemed like forever we found the place. It seemed like an
ideal hangout for students (and backpackers!) on a tight budget. The drink
prices were very cheap and the tapas consisted of fried food in fairly large
serves, even if it was lacking a little in the quality department.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894138352/in/set-72157644104270734" title="The Jewish district by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2909/13894138352_ae5d9cbba3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The Jewish district" class="img-responsive"><em>The Jewish district</em></a></span></p>

<p>The next morning I went exploring the old city with Rachael. We started in the
Jewish district, which had many cobblestone paths featuring the star of David.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894162272/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Cobblestone artwork by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7176/13894162272_0f3cbee403_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Cobblestone artwork" class="img-responsive"><em>Cobblestone artwork</em></a></span></p>

<p>The surrounding area had lots of very ornate cobblestone paths in lots of
different patterns.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894176706/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Street art Owl in Granada by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7052/13894176706_bbd2e3d2a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Street art Owl in Granada" class="img-responsive"><em>Street art Owl in Granada</em></a></span></p>

<p>We explored around an area that our little tourist map told us was full of
street art and found quite a few very nice pieces.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894207302/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Bicycle powered merry-go-round by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7409/13894207302_8c4727d226_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Bicycle powered merry-go-round" class="img-responsive"><em>Bicycle powered merry-go-round</em></a></span></p>

<p>We ventured past a Christmas market at which it seemed like all of the
children&#8217;s rides were human powered, for example this merry-go-round was turned
by a guy peddling a bicycle that was attached. Not sure if they&#8217;re doing it to
save money on a motor, or to be environmentally friendly, but it seemed pretty
cool to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13917758144/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Freaky street performer in front of a church by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3733/13917758144_ca2e006565_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Freaky street performer in front of a church" class="img-responsive"><em>Freaky street performer in front of a church</em></a></span></p>

<p>We passed by the Cathedral and saw this very freaky looking street performer
doing a &#8220;living statue&#8221; thing, which I stealthily took a photo of under the
guise of taking a picture of the church. When we got to close to the cathedral
some old gypsy ladies swarmed us, trying to give us rosemary, shouting stuff at
us in Spanish. I didn&#8217;t want a bar of it but Rachael initially accepted their
rosemary before she realised they wanted money from her, and afterwards decided
that all the shouting they did at her was probably them putting a curse on her.</p>

<p>At lunchtime we sought out a place serving Alhambra brand beer (I seem to have
failed to note what the common beer was in my notes, but it was some other
beer), and we found a great tapas place that gave us bacon wrapped cheese rolls,
prawns, chorizo, and delicious spicy salty squid. I&#8217;m salivating just thinking
about them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894696952/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Band jamming by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5030/13894696952_83c956412f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Band jamming" class="img-responsive"><em>Band jamming</em></a></span></p>

<p>We decided to spend the afternoon doing a short hike we&#8217;d heard about that ran
along the other side of the river, and on out way there we happened to pass some
buskers that included the singer dude from the band a few nights earlier.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13918252094/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Kings and knights patrolling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7073/13918252094_7952020765_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Kings and knights patrolling" class="img-responsive"><em>Kings and knights patrolling</em></a></span></p>

<p>Then a King and a bunch of knights happened to wander past us. Just your average
afternoon in Granada!</p>

<p>We eventually made it to the other side of the river, and followed the path
along to quite a nice view of the caves, and found some more caves on the other
side of the river too. Caves everywhere!</p>

<p>Rachael and I went and tracked down a restaurant we passed on the walking tour
the first day that served snails. Rachael, being a chef, wanted to see how the
Spanish served them, and I&#8217;m always eager to try strange foods. We did manage to
find it, but it was disappointingly closed.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894756511/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Tapas menu by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3694/13894756511_c3bbfc3231_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Tapas menu" class="img-responsive"><em>Tapas menu</em></a></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;d looked up a list of best tapas places in Granada and we went to one called
Babel tapas bar, which claimed to serve world fusion food. The food was great but
the service was pretty poor. It took use nearly two hours to get two drinks each
and tapas. I happened to take a photo of the menu to give you an idea of the
sorts of stuff you get to pick from when you&#8217;re buying a beer in one of these
places. I wish I&#8217;d thought to take more photos of stuff like this, and the tapas
itself.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13894758262/in/set-72157644104270734" title="Giant bowl of snails by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3732/13894758262_17d7c170de_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Giant bowl of snails" class="img-responsive"><em>Giant bowl of snails</em></a></span></p>

<p>We ended up going back to the cheap and tiny place from the previous day, in which
the very cheerful bartender was quick to serve us drinks and delicious tapas.
We saw they offered snails as a non-tapas dish, so we ordered a serve to try
them. What came out what a giant bowl full of snails, probably 40+ of them. I
though they had a kind of odd texture and weren&#8217;t anything to write home about.
I think I prefer the French style ones where you only get a few and they&#8217;re
drowned in butter and garlic.</p>

<p>We finished up the night at a place called Los Diamontes a seafood tapas place
which had rave reviews.  Unfortunately I think we must have gone to the wrong
one (there seems to be two with the same name in Granada). We got a serve of
regular sized prawns, shells and all :/ It was very noisy, all hard surfaces and
no music or anything to help with that. It felt like being in a shopping centre
food court except without the muzak. We decided to call it a night after that.</p>

<p>My last day in Granada I went out to have a look at some of the clothing shops
around the old city. There was lots of awesome hippy-style clothes, all of which
would fit in at the Rainbow Serpent market but very little of which actually
looked like designs I&#8217;d seen at Rainbow Serpent. I checked the tags on a few
things and most of it seems to be made in Nepal. Seems like it would be a good
place to go on a shopping trip.</p>

<p>Leaving Granada I tried using a ride sharing website I&#8217;d just learnt about
called Blablacar. I organised to get a lift to Cordoba, my next stop, with a guy
who was living in Granada on the weekends and working in Cordoba during the
week. He drove a fairly flash 2 door BMW, which was actually kind of cramped
with 4 people in it, but all in all it was a good experience. Seems like the
future of hitchhiking to me.</p>

      Happy travel birthday to me!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/first-birthday-cake.jpg" alt="birthday cake" class="img-responsive" /></span></p>

<p>So today marks my first travel birthday. One year ago today I boarded my first
flight of this trip, leaving my home in Melbourne and headed out to see the
world. Actually, because time zones are always a pain in the ass, it was
actually more like 1 year and 16 hours or something but one year rolls of the
tongue better. It&#8217;s the longest period I&#8217;ve ever been away from Australia by at
least a few months now.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>In that time I&#8217;ve visited heaps of crazy places, done a lot of amazing things,
met numerous of amazing people, and learnt that keeping a blog up to date is
near impossible for me. Even keeping a blog running 4-6 months behind real-time
requires a whole lot more time that I expected. Having that lag actually feels
like a good thing, because it allows me to revisit periods of time and remind
myself of things I had already forgotten, which in turn, helps keep me motivated
to continue working on the blog so I&#8217;ll have something to look back on when I&#8217;m
old and my memory is even worse. That, and because my mum and Amanda like it :P</p>

<p>How do I feel after a year on the road?</p>

<p>I miss home. I miss having a home. I miss my friends and family back home a lot,
even if I&#8217;m terrible at mentioning it and equally as bad at keeping in touch.
I&#8217;m even missing working, which is great as overcoming the burnt out feelings I
was having towards work was one things I really hoped to get out of this trip.</p>

<p>When am I coming home?</p>

<p>After reading the last paragraph you&#8217;d probably be thinking &#8220;soon,&#8221; but that&#8217;s
not the case. Being able to travelling for this long, with this much freedom,
required putting a lot of things on the line: Moving out of the best share house
I&#8217;ve ever lived in, quitting the best job I&#8217;ve ever had (even if I was burning
out), and putting nearly every one of my friendships on hold, hoping that people
will forgive me the negligence when I return.</p>

<p>Given how much energy I invested into making this my reality, I want to push this
as far as I can. There&#8217;s still countless things to see, do or experience (plenty
of which I probably don&#8217;t even know about today) and I&#8217;m going try and keep
seeing, doing and experiencing things while I can.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not actually sure what else to write about here, maybe this is already more
than is necessary, but if you have any questions you&#8217;d like to ask, fire away!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>Even in winter the weather is Barcelona is lovely. As soon as I landed and got
through customs, I put my heavy winter jacket away and was quite comfortable in
just a T-shirt. It seemed like the warm weather would be great for helping me
kick a cold that had been hanging around for my last few weeks in Berlin, which
had left me sniffing and congested for far too long.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809549773/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Sagrada Familia by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3669/13809549773_b5c9a73fbe_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="La Sagrada Familia" class="img-responsive"><em>La Sagrada Familia</em></a></span></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I spent the first few days not doing very much, walking around the city near La
Rambla and enjoying the warmth, and trying to rest up.</p>

<p>Once I was feeling a bit better I took a free walking tour of Barcelona that
went around a number of sites in the heart of Barcelona and gave some background
and history about the city. The tour really made me realise how little I know
about Spanish history, even the quite recent parts. I did not know that they had
had a dictatorship right up until the mid-70s, which was apparently allowed by
the rest of Europe because their dictator hadn&#8217;t supported Hitler in WWII.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807882714/in/set-72157643866689355" title="First glimpse of Caga Tio, the shitting log by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2840/13807882714_d5216a705b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="First glimpse of Caga Tio" class="img-responsive"><em>First glimpse of Caga Tio</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also learnt about some rather unique Catalan Christmas traditions. The first
being Caga Tio (Literal translation: Uncle Shit), a log with a smiling face and
a blanket. Each day leading up to Christmas the kids beat Caga Tio with sticks
&#8220;to help with digestion&#8221;. Then on Christmas day, if the kids have beaten him
enough to help him with his digestion problems, they peer under Caga Tio&#8217;s
blanket and find that he&#8217;s pooped out a load of candy. An important life lesson
to teach your kids!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810536113/in/set-72157643866689355" title="So many caganers by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7126/13810536113_62c182214f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="So many caganers" class="img-responsive"><em>So many caganers</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another strange Catalan Christmas tradition is the caganer. The caganer is a
little man, squatted over with his arse hanging out of his pants, and on the
ground behind him is a freshly made turd. He&#8217;s apparently hidden somewhere in
every good Catalan person&#8217;s nativity scene, and the kids love to search for him.
There was stall after stall selling these caganers, which you can get in the
likeness of all kinds of celebrities, the most distasteful being Nelson Mandela
the very same week he died. The guide said the caganer had something to do with
the idea of giving back to the earth, but it just seems like they&#8217;re obsessed
with poop to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807913783/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Nathalie, Ibrahim and me by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7309/13807913783_34a18f23dc_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Nathalie, Ibrahim and me" class="img-responsive"><em>Nathalie, Ibrahim and me</em></a></span></p>

<p>One evening I arranged to meet up with one of my old Envato workmates Ibrahim,
and his beautiful wife Nathalie, to go and eat at a really nice tapas place they
had told me about.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807896004/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Tapas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7013/13807896004_9b77c7e756_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Awsome tapas" class="img-responsive"><em>Awsome tapas</em></a></span></p>

<p>The place did not disappoint, everything we tried was delicious from the Spanish
ham and croquettes to the not-so-traditional perfectly cooked little steak
bites, with delightful sangria to wash it all down. I think my stand-out
favourite was the little sandwiches with
<a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/sobrasada_de_bellota.jpg">sobrasada</a> (basically spreadable chorizo) and
melted cheese. Spreadable meat seems like it should be a bit wrong, but it tasted
fantastic. I&#8217;m told that when <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/sturicho.jpg">sturicho</a> was visiting he
loved the stuff too; Ibby said he probably would have brushed his teeth with the
stuff if he could have :P</p>

<p>It was great to see Ibrahim and Nathalie again, they&#8217;re both such kind
hospitable people. It&#8217;s always a pleasure spending time with them and I look
forward to (hopefully) being able to converse in Spanish with them the next time
we meet.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13807979643/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Palau G&#xFC;ell's beautiful entrance by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7071/13807979643_2e3c6aae51_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Palau G&#xFC;ell's beautiful entrance" class="img-responsive"><em>Palau G&#xFC;ell&#8217;s beautiful entrance</em></a></span></p>

<p>I managed to get along to see Güell palace, a building that was once the home of
the Güell family, and which had been closed for renovations the last time I was
in Barcelona.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808355844/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Parabolic arches by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7302/13808355844_14212b2d48_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Parabolic arches" class="img-responsive"><em>Parabolic arches</em></a></span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s another very beautiful building designed by Gaudí, designed with lots of
smooth curves and vibrant colour. Gaudí used a lot of parabolic arches and other
unique geometry in his designs which give both strength as well as visually
interesting features to the building.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808807974/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Wrought iron work by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3801/13808807974_c1b85cb2b3_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Wrought iron work" class="img-responsive"><em>Wrought iron work</em></a></span></p>

<p>It featured a lot of quite complex wrought iron work which must have been made
by very skilled craftsmen. It was all so neat and regular, it&#8217;s hard to believe
it wasn&#8217;t done by a machine.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808579334/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Palau G&#xFC;ell chimneys by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3819/13808579334_34846ded2c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Palau G&#xFC;ell chimneys" class="img-responsive"><em>Palau G&#xFC;ell chimneys</em></a></span></p>

<p>Up on the roof there were heaps of colourful chimneys, no two the same. Many
were decorated with lots of tiny bits of broken tile, a style heavily used by
Gaudí in a lot of his works, but there were also a few that were just red bricks
built in interesting formations.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808511193/in/set-72157643866689355" title="The bullring shopping center by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3830/13808511193_4e985a5e60_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The bullring shopping center" class="img-responsive"><em>The bullring shopping center</em></a></span></p>

<p>I made a visit  to Plaza de España to go up to the roof of Arenas de Barcelona,
an old bullring that has since been converted into a shopping centre. There&#8217;s a
lift out the front that you have to pay a few Euro to get up to the viewing
platform on the roof, or you can go inside the shopping centre and use the
escalators and get up there for free.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808520673/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Looking out from the rooftop, straight at a hotel pool by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3684/13808520673_8e1f63c67c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Looking out from the rooftop, straight at a hotel pool" class="img-responsive"><em>Looking out from the rooftop, straight at a hotel pool</em></a></span></p>

<p>From the roof you get a nice view of the city in most directions. You also get a
view looking straight at a hotel&#8217;s swimming pool. I imagine it was built long
before the viewing platform was there, but I can&#8217;t imaging people rushing to use
the pool now with hoards of people at Arenas looking straight out at you.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808555395/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Montju&#xEF;c Castle by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5504/13808555395_c2fe7003c2_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Montju&#xEF;c Castle" class="img-responsive"><em>Montju&#xEF;c Castle</em></a></span></p>

<p>From there I got a bus to Montjuïc Castle and explore. I remember visiting here
the last time I was in town, and the building seemed mostly how I remembered it,
although I&#8217;m pretty sure it wasn&#8217;t free last time and now it is :D</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808612155/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Barcelona by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7004/13808612155_755dbcd073_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="Barcelona" class="img-responsive"><em>Barcelona</em></a></span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s up on top of a hill, so it&#8217;s another great place to get a view of Barcelona.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to see a light/water/sound show known as &#8220;The Magic
Fountain&#8221;. When I arrived there was an absolutely massive crowd and the show
seemed to be delayed. Nobody seemed to have much of an idea what was going on so
I ducked off for a quick drink, then from where I was having my drink I saw a
huge fireworks show going off from the direction of the fountain. It wouldn&#8217;t
have seemed out of place on the TV amongst a wrap-up of the years NYE fireworks,
it was really epic. I found out later that this was just for some couples wedding&#8230;
rich people!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808981964/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Magic fountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2909/13808981964_21e85ea3b0_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Magic fountain" class="img-responsive"><em>Magic fountain</em></a></span></p>

<p>Anyway, I went back to the fountain and found that now that the fireworks were
over they were back to a more normal schedule for the fountain. I took a seat
and watched the wonderfully synchronised display. Some of the water effects were
really foamy, and light and fluffy looking, and the lights coming through made it look like some
sort of magic smoke. Really cool to see.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810906184/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell Logo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5321/13810906184_e7aab18a47_c.jpg" width="800" height="504" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell Logo" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell Logo</em></a></span></p>

<p>On a day that happened to be another public holiday I tried to go to Sagrada
Familia, but the queue went right around the block. I wasn&#8217;t really keen on
waiting for hours to get in and have the place be cramped full of people so I
went to Park Güell instead.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809086694/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell main stairway by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7090/13809086694_ec3de27f4a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell main stairway" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell main stairway</em></a></span></p>

<p>Sadly the public holiday meant even though I didn&#8217;t have to wait long to get in,
the park was packed to the rafters with people and felt like a circus. Nothing
like the peaceful, attractive park I had such nice memories of.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13808713993/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Spiral pillars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7230/13808713993_668bf0eec4_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Spiral pillars" class="img-responsive"><em>Spiral pillars</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was really challenging to get a nice photo of any of the signature parts of
the park without a dozen people also in the shot posing for their next Facebook
avatar. I did manage to get a few shots that might mislead you into thinking it
wasn&#8217;t like that at all, but that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;m both stubborn and patient
and will wait around for 10+ minutes waiting for that tiny gap.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809144934/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell dragon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2866/13809144934_9a03d34057_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell dragon" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell dragon</em></a></span></p>

<p>The most well known part of the park, the dragon, was a nightmare. There was an
endless line of people waiting to rush in for their photo, myself included. I
did manage to get one nice shot of it by itself, but the photos with me in them
all had photobombers in the background.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809190964/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Park G&#xFC;ell by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7395/13809190964_2a5f3c5741_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Park G&#xFC;ell" class="img-responsive"><em>Park G&#xFC;ell</em></a></span></p>

<p>I ended up leaving feeling a bit sick (the cold was still hanging around),
frustrated and generally fed up with large crowds. I probably should have just
rested on the public holidays and gone the next day.</p>

<p>I noticed that there was a couch surfing meet up happening at a little flamenco
concert at a bar on the other side of town, so I headed over to check it out. I
met a bunch of lovely South Americans there who all lived in Barcelona now. It
was nice to hear some Spanish that I knew was actually Spanish for a change, all
the Catalan that&#8217;s spoken in Barcelona is really off-putting for a Spanish
learner.</p>

<p>The flamenco show had beautifully played guitar and singing, and some <em>very</em>
passionate dancing. I had a &#8220;front row&#8221; seat, which meant the woman dancing was
often facing right towards me, barely 2ft away, which did make me feel quite
uncomfortable and self-conscious. My brain is weird sometimes.</p>

<p>One of the couch surfers was a nice girl from Chile, Natalia, who insists that I
get in touch with her where I go to Chile or Uruguay, so she can put me in touch
with her friends there to maybe stay with them. Win!</p>

<p>Next up went and had a look at Casa Batlló, another home designed by Gaudí.
A lot of parts of the place have a bit of a dragon theme to them, with lots of scales
and bone-like features on the façade and several more within.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809039093/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Whirlpool ceiling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7357/13809039093_b7955d4fc3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Whirlpool ceiling" class="img-responsive"><em>Whirlpool ceiling</em></a></span></p>

<p>This room had a very unique ceiling that spiralled around to look like a
whirlpool vortex, with curved walls, curved doors&#8230; pretty much curved
everything.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809204735/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Casa Batll&#xF3; by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2832/13809204735_0f45c216f5_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Casa Batll&#xF3;" class="img-responsive"><em>Casa Batll&#xF3;</em></a></span></p>

<p>The internal stairwell is tiled with blue tiles, but with darker tiles at the
top, slowly fading to lighter blue tiles at the bottom. This was done to
compensate for the colours being washed out by the bright light of the skylight
when looking up, so it would appear a uniform blue, and it worked pretty well at
doing so.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809366973/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Casa Batll&#xF3; rooftop by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7117/13809366973_f627feefd8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Casa Batll&#xF3; rooftop" class="img-responsive"><em>Casa Batll&#xF3; rooftop</em></a></span></p>

<p>Up on the rooftop there were more zany chimneys, decorated with the broken tile
style. I don&#8217;t know why every fireplace needs it&#8217;s own separate chimney at the
very top, but it makes them look interesting at least.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809385475/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Dragon scale tiles by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7401/13809385475_22543ea05a_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Dragon scale tiles" class="img-responsive"><em>Dragon scale tiles</em></a></span></p>

<p>The roof tiles used on the very top of the façade really look like scales, with
the ridge of the roof looking kind of like a colourful spine. Yet another
building that would have been so cool to actually live in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810183203/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Epic lighting by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7222/13810183203_d87235eb86_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Epic lighting inside La Sagrada Familia" class="img-responsive"><em>Epic lighting inside La Sagrada Familia</em></a></span></p>

<p>I returned to La Sagrada Familia and this time the lines were far more
reasonable and I got in in about 20 minutes. This was one of my favourite
buildings the last time I came to Spain and it still is today. It&#8217;s probably my
single favourite building anywhere in the world. A big call, but it&#8217;s one heck
of an impressive structure.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810039463/in/set-72157643866689355" title="The passion fa&#xE7;ade by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3750/13810039463_727a96e8f0_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The passion fa&#xE7;ade" class="img-responsive"><em>The passion fa&#xE7;ade</em></a></span></p>

<p>The building has been under construction for around 130 years now, with
information in the museum estimating it will be completed in 2030, so I may even
live to see it finished. My favourite side of the building last time was &#8220;The
Passion&#8221; façade, which this time unfortunately was partially covered in
scaffolding. The sculpture style is very angular and not really attempting to
look really human, which I feel makes it far more interesting than the generic
style that seems to dominate sculpture.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810295075/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Model of the completed Sagrada Familia by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7096/13810295075_f30b748621_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Model of the completed Sagrada Familia" class="img-responsive"><em>Model of the completed Sagrada Familia</em></a></span></p>

<p>I found this model and learnt that even though the building is already huge, the
5 or 6 tallest towers are not built yet. The central &#8220;Jesus&#8221; tower alone is
going to be nearly double the height of any of the existing ones. Epic!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810099654/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Inside a tower through the doorway arch by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2895/13810099654_fd5569be9d_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Inside a tower through the doorway arch" class="img-responsive"><em>Inside a tower through the doorway arch</em></a></span></p>

<p>I got to go up inside one of the Nativity towers, which thankfully they have an
elevator to take you up. You get a good view of the city, some interesting
angles on the construction that&#8217;s taking place, and some eery long drops to look
down the middle of spiral staircases.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13809927463/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Spiral! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7249/13809927463_026c86c61a_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Spiral!" class="img-responsive"><em>Spiral!</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was a lot of steps down from the tower, in a rather tight and dizzying
spiral, but it&#8217;s way better walking down steps than up them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810315284/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Stunning lighting in the afternoon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7340/13810315284_70ee143cc7_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Stunning lighting in the afternoon" class="img-responsive"><em>Stunning lighting in the afternoon</em></a></span></p>

<p>The time of day, and the intense brightness of the suns, meant that the stained
glass was casting lots of wonderfully pretty light inside the building. There
are still large area where the windows are just plain glass, so I can only
imagine the rainbow this place will be when all the windows are done.</p>

<p>I just love all the clean complexity of all the shapes involved, with so much of
it coming from fairly simple math and geometry concepts. The columns for example
are <a href="http://www.sagradafamilia.cat/sf-eng/docs_instit/geometria1.php">double
twisted</a>,
meaning that they have twice as many &#8220;sides&#8221; at their tops than they
do at the bottom, and there&#8217;s no sudden point where this shape change takes
place. There was a video of the machine they used to produce them and it was
mesmerizing to watch. <a href="http://www.sagradafamilia.cat/sf-eng/docs_instit/geometria1.php">The whole geometry
section</a> of the
official site is worth checking out if you like that kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810328804/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Rainbow pillars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2919/13810328804_7ac1795f11_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Rainbow pillars" class="img-responsive"><em>Rainbow pillars</em></a></span></p>

<p>That was in the very interesting museum underneath that I don&#8217;t recall from
last time. There was lots of information about the design, including a replica
of the hanging model of the building, made from string and sandbag weights,
which was used to work out the correct angles for everything to bear the weight.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started to wonder what my photos from last time I visited looked like, and
if I had enough foresight to take photos of both the completed and under
construction parts of the building to compare. This time I made sure I took some
photos of the construction, which while not particularly interesting now, will
be great to look back on in 20 years and seeing this massive structure still
heavily in progress.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13810745704/in/set-72157643866689355" title="Crazy rainbow building by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3706/13810745704_f46a278fb5_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Crazy rainbow building" class="img-responsive"><em>Crazy rainbow building</em></a></span></p>

<p>The last thing of note I checked out was this strange egg shaped building called
Torre Agbar. At night the building is a slowly changing cloud of colours. It&#8217;s
quite impressive to see a 30+ story building semi-randomly changing colours in
the darkness.</p>

      <p>One very cold a miserable morning I went to see Sachsenhausen concentration
camp, out at Oranienburg. The camp was about a two kilometre walk from the
station in literally freezing cold mist.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574136123/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Sachsenhausen concentration camp by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5154/13574136123_5128f1e198_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Sachsenhausen concentration camp" class="img-responsive"><em>Sachsenhausen concentration camp</em></a></span></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This camp had been used by the Nazis during the war, but also used by the
Russians around 1945-50 after the war ended, who continued to the use the camp
to kill those who opposed the Russian control of East Germany after the war.
There was lots of info about individual prisoners accounts and that sort of
thing, but it was all just small fragments so I left without a very good picture
of what things were like during that later period.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574588603/in/set-72157643245435323" title="The part used by Russia after WWII by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2865/13574588603_d6129b1b7b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The part used by Russia after WWII" class="img-responsive"><em>The part used by Russia after WWII</em></a></span></p>

<p>The foundations of the buildings containing the gas chambers and the oven were
all that is left of that structure. The building also contained the neck-shot
room, in which they would tell the prisoners they were going to measure their
height against a tape measure on the wall, but then a person in the adjoining
room would fire a shot through a slit in the wall straight into their neck,
killing them. The Nazis were not nice people at all.</p>

<p>The exhibition in the infirmary had mention of there being a brothel on site,
where some females prisoners were forced to work, being raped by soldiers and
selected prisoners as a means of rewarding them. Really messed up stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574950624/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Guard tower by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2816/13574950624_3b90ef9ba6_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Guard tower" class="img-responsive"><em>Guard tower</em></a></span></p>

<p>It was cold enough the day I was there that most water on the ground had frozen
solid, and the misty rain that started again as the sun was setting was
unpleasantly cold, but strangely appropriate for the setting. It really helped
imagine how hard it would have been being a new prisoner arriving in the winter,
being given only summer clothes and made to stand out in the yard for 24 hours,
not being allowed to move. I&#8217;m not surprised by how many died on their first
night there.</p>

<p>After leaving the camp I walked past a gluhwein seller not far down the road
who was an absolute lifesaver. There&#8217;s nothing like a hot, alcoholic beverage to
warm your chilled bones.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I had to move out from the Nicoles place as they had
a friend coming to stay for Thanksgiving. I was sad to be leaving, they&#8217;re both
really lovely people. They made me feel right at home while I was there with
them, so welcoming and friendly.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576145783/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2835/13576145783_14b4d46382_c.jpg" width="765" height="800" alt="Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort" class="img-responsive"><em>Me and the two Nicoles, hiding out behind a tea fort</em></a></span></p>

<p>Random fact about Nicole and Nicole is they like tea, and own enough of it to build a
tea-fort.</p>

<p>I moved to a hostel which had great reviews online, but turned out was almost
solely inhabited by very blokey Australian guys, aside from the one staff member
there who was English I think and very camp. I felt pretty out of place to put
it nicely.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574866713/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Beate Uhse Erotic Museum by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/5278/13574866713_2ab2331733_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Beate Uhse Erotic Museum" class="img-responsive"><em>Beate Uhse Erotic Museum</em></a></span></p>

<p>I went and had a look at an erotic museum, part of the oldest sex shop in the
world: Beate Uhse. It seemed like there was a lot of potential to have been a
very interesting museum but I found the place sort of dull. One of the two
floors was almost solely about the woman who owned it, and the other floor was
full of drawings and things that you could have told me were kitsch holiday
souvenirs and I wouldn&#8217;t have blinked.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576132425/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Nicole and Nicole are lovely people by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3798/13576132425_d19510e3d9_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Nicole and Nicole are lovely people" class="img-responsive"><em>Nicole and Nicole are lovely people</em></a></span></p>

<p>Having only just left the Nicoles place, I was invited back the next night to
take part in their Thanksgivukah celebrations, combining Thanksgiving and
Hanukkah. My first exposure to either holiday :D The food  was delicious, mostly
vegetarian or vegan, and the deserts were sickeningly sweet!  It was nice to
meet some of their friends, one of whom was an Australian girl who was also born
in Wagga Wagga (the amusingly named town I was born in), and also moved away at
a very young age. What are the odds?</p>

<p>I got a message from Harmen that he was back in Berlin again so we met up and
visited the DDR museum, a museum about how things were in East Germany during
the communist era. It was a great exhibition, but it&#8217;s crying out for a bigger
space. The exhibition is overflowing with so much stuff to show that half of it
is hidden behind little flaps you open or in drawers that you pull out, which
isn&#8217;t really compatible with having the place so packed full of people that
there&#8217;s no room to open the exhibitions. Hopefully the popularity will lead to
them thinking about a bigger venue.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13574951913/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Me in a Trabant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7361/13574951913_4fec5217ce_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Me in a Trabant" class="img-responsive"><em>Me in a Trabant</em></a></span></p>

<p>One really neat thing there was the recreation of the inside of an East
German apartment, complete with hidden bugs that you could listen to from
another room in the museum.</p>

<p>After the museum we went to to a brew pub called Brew Baker, that I&#8217;d been told
had an amazing pumpkin ale on a special brew, a style of beer that I&#8217;d never
tried before. The pumpkin ale was alright, but the IPA and a super sweet dark
beer they also had were my favourites. It was located inside a really nice
looking little indoor market.</p>

<p>It was around this time I went and spent a day exploring Spreepark, an old
abandoned theme park in a pretty derelict state that I <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/2013/12/05/spreepark-Berlin">blogged about earlier
here</a>. Just recently I
saw <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/berlin-just-bought-abandoned-theme-park-180950287/">this
article</a>
saying that the city of Berlin has now bought the park, so I may have gotten in
just in time to see it before it gets redeveloped into something else.</p>

<p>One morning I tried to go and see Schloss Charlottenburg, a huge palace now used
as a museum, but I didn&#8217;t think about the fact it was Monday so the building was
closed. I did get to explore the gardens though, which were really beautiful.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575266765/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Charlottenburg Palace gardens by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7113/13575266765_a2c54864c0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Charlottenburg Palace gardens" class="img-responsive"><em>Charlottenburg Palace gardens</em></a></span></p>

<p>There was a lovely light frosting on the certain parts of the very neatly
manicured garden which gave a lovely effect.</p>

<p>I spent my last few evenings in Berlin venturing around to various Christmas
markets. At home I&#8217;ve felt jaded about Christmas for many years, but there was
something about Christmas in Berlin that got through to me.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575685933/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Christmas Markets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7378/13575685933_404c26c7ae_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets" class="img-responsive"><em>Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets</em></a></span></p>

<p>For once it didn&#8217;t feel like a giant event organised by big companies to sell
more shit you don&#8217;t really need. There was great food, tasty beverages, rides
and amusements and most importantly there were jolly people having a good time.
This is quite a contrast that to my image of Christmas back home: overcrowded
shopping malls full of grumpy people who don&#8217;t want to be there, and it&#8217;s easy
to see why I prefer the way Berlin does it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576063984/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Gluhwein! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7368/13576063984_d6d4128944_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Gluhwein!" class="img-responsive"><em>Gluhwein!</em></a></span></p>

<p>The first market I went to explore was the huge one set up near Alexanderplatz,
which was kind of like a big show in a country town. There were loads of places
selling gluhwein; you could get the regular stuff, optionally with a shot of
spirits or schnapps, or eierpunsch, which is yellow and creamy like eggnog,
super sweet and with whipped cream on top. They even had gluhbier, spiced beer
served warm that was rich and a little sweet. Naturally I had to try all of
them. Some of them more than once.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576186964/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Christmas Markets by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3694/13576186964_b29f3390fb_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets" class="img-responsive"><em>Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets</em></a></span></p>

<p>I had some tasty shredded pork stuff for dinner, and a bag of &#8220;donut hole&#8221; type
things for desert, and boy did I feel sick afterwards from eating all that sweet
stuff.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576273754/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Bergstra&#xDF;e, the last street still cut off by the Berlin wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3730/13576273754_865530b401_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Bergstra&#xDF;e, the last street still cut off by the Berlin wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Bergstra&#xDF;e, the last street still cut off by the Berlin wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>I spent my last day  at the Berlin Wall memorial. There are fragments of the
multiple layers of wall, and there is a street that the wall still crosses
which is the last street still cut off by the wall today.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576371664/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Deadzone through a crack in the wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7348/13576371664_0933a8fc86_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Deadzone through a crack in the wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Deadzone through a crack in the wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a section that has been rebuilt to have both complete walls, a
guard tower and lights, giving you a much better feeling how it would have
really felt to be trapped in East Germany during the Soviet era.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576109973/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Wall reconstuction as seen from the viewing platform by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3819/13576109973_71720c6006_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wall reconstuction as seen from the viewing platform" class="img-responsive"><em>Wall reconstuction as seen from the viewing platform</em></a></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a viewing tower built nearby so you can get a more elevated view of
the whole thing.</p>

<p>There were some interesting stories about buildings that were right along the
border, that had doors opening both into East and West Berlin, allowing the
owners access to both sides. Eventually the West German side was bricked up to
stop people escaping via these houses, then the people were evicted, and finally
the buildings were torn down.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576059895/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Bernauer Stra&#xDF;e by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7390/13576059895_af1afc3e82_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Bernauer Stra&#xDF;e Station" class="img-responsive"><em>Bernauer Stra&#xDF;e Station</em></a></span></p>

<p>West Berlin also had the underground train network, parts of which passed
through under East Berlin city centre, but to stop people escaping through the
metro tunnels the stations in East Berlin were bricked up and abandoned.
Bernauer Straße station was one such station, but you wouldn&#8217;t know it today.</p>

<p>I snuck in an amazing last lunch at a nice little place not far from the heart
of the city, and ate this amazingly good pork knuckle. The meat was so tender it
just fell apart; I could have eaten it with just a fork.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13787696054" title="Amazing pork knuckle, the meat was so very tender by Lucas Parry, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3766/13787696054_4316f8a490_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Amazing pork knuckle, the meat was so very tender" class="img-responsive"><em>Amazing pork knuckle, the meat was so very tender</em></a></span></p>

<p>My bill came and it was mysteriously discounted by 20%, and I was so happy with
the meal I tipped the 20% right back to them. :D</p>

<p>My last night in Berlin I hit a few more of the more traditional style Christmas
markets at PrenzlauerBerg and Charlottenburg. These ones were far less fun-park
like and had even more variety in food and handicrafts.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576227415/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Swinging Barbecue by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7397/13576227415_9b6456df0d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Swinging Barbecue at PrenzlauerBerg" class="img-responsive"><em>Swinging Barbecue at PrenzlauerBerg</em></a></span></p>

<p>PrenzlauerBerg had a strong showing of Swedish and Finnish stalls with their own
takes on Gluhwein.  There was also some huge BBQs where the grill was suspended
by chains above the coals, slowly swinging and turning. I&#8217;m not sure if it had a
functional purpose but it looked cool!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13576305803/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3798/13576305803_c78197835f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market" class="img-responsive"><em>Charlottenburg Palace Christmas Market</em></a></span></p>

<p>The Charlottenburg markets were out the front of Charlottenburg Palace, with
lots and lots of food places. I had myself an epic roast dinner, then a huge
Hungarian donut thing before stumbling home to my hostel to get ready for my
flight the next morning to Spain.</p>

      <p>I did a huge amount of exploration around Berlin appreciating the street art,
probably at least 4-5 days whole days worth in total if you added it all up. I
did a few &#8220;self guided&#8221; walking tours (as in I had an itinerary or stuff to look
for that I found somewhere online), A ton of randomly wandering after spotting a
cool piece by chance, and a &#8220;Real Berlin&#8221; free walking tour that turned out to
be quite heavily street art focused.</p>

<p>On one of my many aimless explorations I stumbled upon some buskers playing in
the street who were drawing quite a crowd.  A band called <a href="http://www.thetroublenotes.com/">The Trouble
Notes</a>. One guy planing an electric violin, one
guy finger picking the heck out of a guitar while also using it as a percussion
instrument, and another dude sitting on a unique drum that was just kind of a
square box. They had a very beautiful sound and were so damn good I stopped and
listened to them for probably an hour.  I even bought a CD to support them, even
though I have nothing to play it in. I also got a flyer for a show later in the
month in a very obscure warehouse venue.</p>

<p>I moved in to the Nicoles&#8217; place on the day of a &#8220;crafternoon&#8221; that was still in
progress when I arrived. I hung out and tried to make an origami animal that had
been stumping everyone all afternoon (damned if I can remember what the animal
was now, a whale maybe?), but we struggled with it for a very long time before
discovering there were instruction in the front of the book explaining the
meaning of all the different fold-arrows.  With this Nicole A was finally able
to successfully make the animal! I thought only men didn&#8217;t read instructions,
but now I know better :P</p>

<p>I spent an entire day exploring the street art around Warschauer Straße Station,
in and amongst the converted warehouse along Revaler Straße. This area oozes
creativity, with nearly every surface being covered in colourful murals and most
of the people around there looked like the sorts of folk my dad would look at
disapprovingly as dirty hippies. My kind of people! :)</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13564232873/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Berlin by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3724/13564232873_e9b584efaf_c.jpg" width="800" height="447" alt="Berlin mural on the East Side Gallery" class="img-responsive"><em>Berlin mural on the East Side Gallery</em></a></span></p>

<p>I walked along the nearby East Side Gallery, a 1.3km long section of the Berlin
Wall that is now used as an open air art gallery. There over 100 painting, all
of them enormous. There was also a whole row of Trabants, the car of East Germany,
parked along the side the wall.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13563950605/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Trabants by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2816/13563950605_04431b441e_c.jpg" width="800" height="752" alt="Trabants along side the wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Trabants along side the wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>I walked the whole length of the wall and then along some of the backside as
well and was lucky enough to come upon a bunch of artists spending their Sunday
afternoon painting the back of the wall and having a few beers. Art in progress
:D</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13564854475/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Sunday drinks while painting the wall by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/3679/13564854475_694238308f_c.jpg" width="800" height="290" alt="Sunday drinks while painting the wall" class="img-responsive"><em>Sunday drinks while painting the wall</em></a></span></p>

<p>Another day I went on a &#8220;Real Berlin Walking Tour&#8221;, as recommended by another
friend who lived in Berlin briefly and highly recommended it. The tour had a
strong focus on graffiti and street art, which I didn&#8217;t know about beforehand
and meant we went to several places I&#8217;d already checked out. It was great to
have a knowledgeable guide there to point specific artists works and styles, and
then start recognising their stuff all around the city.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565480803/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Garbage Elephant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7131/13565480803_2d4637d7f0_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Garbage Elephant by a crew who make art from stuff they find on the street" class="img-responsive"><em>Garbage Elephant by a crew who make art from stuff they find on the street</em></a></span></p>

<p>It seemed like our guide must have been well connected in with the street art
community based on how much he seemed to know about individual artists,
techniques, etc. I almost suspect he may have actually been one of the artists,
although he denied it when I asked him directly.</p>

<p>On the tour I learned some more about the Berlin wall and the Cold War. One
interesting titbit I picked up was that West Berlin was the only part of West
Germany that didn&#8217;t have conscription, which led to many of the liberals
migrating there, which could very well explain the very liberal culture that
exists there today.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13565231714/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7038/13565231714_49c68617c3_c.jpg" width="800" height="391" alt="Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river" class="img-responsive"><em>Eyesore being built right between the wall and the river</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also learned how property developers have been permitted to start developing
along the lovely green strip behind the long strip of wall that makes up the
East Side Gallery. What a complete fuck up! I thought that the one building that
was in progress was a horribly inconvenient eye sore, meaning you could no
longer walk along the full length of both sides of the wall. To find out they&#8217;re
now planning on building along most of that strip, including a section currently
occupied by an African Youth support centre who are being evicted, is terrible.
Wikipedia even tells me they&#8217;re going to knock down extensive segments of the
gallery.</p>

<p>Another day I visited the Deutsches Technikmuseum, the German Museum of
Technology. I love science and technology museums as a rule, although this one
had such a heavy focus on trains and planes that you could be forgiven for
thinking it was just a transport museum.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568945104/in/set-72157643245435323" title="This musuem had a crazy number of planes in it by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2807/13568945104_6685df757b_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="This musuem had so many planes they needed to mount this one vertically" class="img-responsive"><em>This musuem had so many planes they needed to mount this one vertically</em></a></span></p>

<p>I especially liked this jet engine that was opened up so I could poke my head
right inside and get an idea of what the insides of one of those things looks
like and how the &#8220;reverse thrust&#8221; thing planes do to stop actually works. I&#8217;ve
since tried to look out the window on a flight as we landed to try see this in
action but the wing gets in the way. :(</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568499815/in/set-72157643245435323" title='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr'><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7408/13568499815_3175e0b7e5_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt='Jet engine, the back is open in the "braking" position' class="img-responsive"><em>Jet engine, the back is open in the &#8220;braking&#8221; position</em></a></span></p>

<p>There were some other smaller sections about old bicycles, medicine,
photography, old mechanical computers and televisions.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13567596055/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Wooden bike by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7077/13567596055_f5671ee900_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Wooden bike, totally hipster" class="img-responsive"><em>Wooden bike, totally hipster</em></a></span></p>

<p>Some of the old televisions had Cathode Ray tubes so long that they would
orient them with the screen facing the ceiling, and then use a 45º mirror to
flip the image so a sitting viewer could watch it. To think today there are
2+ metre televisions that are only a few cm thick&#8230; The progress of technology
is awesome!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13567824574/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Antique televisions.

<p>There was also a historical brewery, complete with shiny copper mash &amp; lauter tun
and boiler.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13568269805/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Historic brewhaus by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7181/13568269805_54ecd3472a_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Historic brewhaus" class="img-responsive"><em>Historic brewhaus</em></a></span></p>

<p>One evening while I was still staying with the two Nicoles, I went and saw The
Trouble Notes do a live show, with the two of them and a friend of theirs. The
venue was an old building hidden down a very dark alley, surrounded by building
that felt like they were largely abandoned. It felt like the kind of place you
went down to get stabbed, but it turned out fine for us. The Trouble Notes put on
very good show, even if the support act was a bit too emo and the venue was
super smoky.  It really feels like I got in a time machine and went back 20
years to be back in a place where you can smoke in public venues.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of days exploring the various museums on the Museum Island.
First up was the Pergamon museum, which has in it&#8217;s collection a giant
Babylonian gate, and an ancient temple plundered from turkey.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570513833/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Pergamon Altar by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7315/13570513833_b093193675_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Pergamon Altar" class="img-responsive"><em>Pergamon Altar</em></a></span></p>

<p>I read up and learnt that the Babylonian gate on display is actually the
smaller, rear-side of the entrance way. The front must have been absolutely
epic!</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570336943/in/set-72157643245435323" title="Ishtar Gate by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/7338/13570336943_508a1c623f_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Ishtar Gate" class="img-responsive"><em>Ishtar Gate</em></a></span></p>

<p>The New Museum was great, I found the building itself to be very interesting,
with each room styled differently and quite uniquely. Much of it has been
reconstructed since the war. It&#8217;s funny, the place felt way too old to be
calling it &#8220;the new museum&#8221;.</p>

<p class="flickr-image-container"><span class="polaroid"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13570806863/in/set-72157643245435323" title="More plundered loot by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/images/cache/2816/13570806863_91ff2f0594_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="More plundered loot in the New Museum" class="img-responsive"><em>More plundered loot in the New Museum</em></a></span></p>

<p>I also went to the Old Museum which looks really majestic from the outside, but
I felt the inside of the building lacked any real character and was rather dull
and sterile.</p>

<p>One morning I booked in to visit the Reichstag Building (the German Parliament),
a building with an impressive glass dome on top of it, which you can go up for a
nice view. It&#8217;s free but you have to book online in advance.</p>

<p>Surprise track work meant that I was pretty late, I&#8217;d left home cutting things
pretty fine according to Google maps estimations, but then there were no trains
running on the line I needed to change to, so I had to go to another station on
a different line, then practically run to try and get there near the time I was
scheduled to, all the while being mobbed by supposedly deaf street collectors.</p>

<p>The collectors hand you a card with a little statement in a bunch of languages
asking you to sign their clipboard (petition? I cant remember), then if you
don&#8217;t read that clipboard you suddenly find you&#8217;ve signed up to make a donation.
Call me a cynic, but those deaf collectors look just like the gypsies in every
other city in Europe.  I suspect they&#8217;ve just come up with a new way of
extracting money from people without having to know a word of any language in
particular.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Reichstag was a very impressive building, the inside of the dome
contains a system of mirrors which collect and reflect light down into the
parliament, lessening the need for artificial lighting. Really clever stuff.</p>

<p>There was a ramp spiralling up around the dome, with an audio guide that is
automatically activated as you walk around, giving you a nice (but hard to
photograph) view of the city in all directions.</p>

<p>One place I had hesitations about visiting the was Checkpoint Charlie Museum,
because the street outside makes the whole area feel like an awful tourist trap.
Inside it turned out to be nothing of the sort and was way better than I
expected.</p>

<p>It contained lots of interesting stories about the many successful and
unsuccessful attempts to escape from East Germany to flee to the west.  There
were stories about escapes hidden in the modified car engine bays, secret
compartments in large welding machines, one woman who hid in a pair of connected
suitcases side by side on the luggage rack of a train, hot air balloons,
gliders, even some attempts in homemade submarines in the Baltic sea. The museum
was actually quite large, but I think the layout means a lot of people miss half
of it. I pretty much had the place to myself in that section.</p>
