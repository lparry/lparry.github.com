      <p>It&#8217;s 2014 and you&#8217;ll probably notice things look quite a bit different. I&#8217;ve
done what any good procrastinator would do when faced with little to no internet
and a lot of time to spare; I&#8217;ve completely revamped my blog so it&#8217;s nicer to
work with when I dont have internet, and have a copy that works without relying
on the existance of tumblr. (Sorry Amanda, I bet you thought I was going to
actually have written a post about Turkey at last :P)</p>

<p>Anyhow, comments from the old site should migrate over in the next 24 hours. Let
me know if you notice anything that looks broken.</p>

      <p>Breaking chronology for a change because I love these photos so much.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of old abandoned things in Berlin; there are entire sites dedicated to what&#8217;s out there, how to get in, what are the risks, etc. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated seeing old places that would have been someone&#8217;s home or workplace for years on end, but one day left to rot and let nature start reclaiming. I love seeing photos of such places, and the few abandoned places I have been very cool experiences.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224500606/" title="Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7392/11224500606_cf5f0ec5de_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>One of the places in Berlin that really sounded unique was an old theme park, the Spreepark, which existed way back in the days of East German, becoming more westernised after the reunification of Germany. It was abandoned in 2001 and has since become thoroughly derelict. I read that you can get in to the site through gaps in the fence, but there are often security you have to watch out for, possibly with dogs, so when I found out that they&#8217;d started doing tours of the place on Sundays I decided to take the easy way out and pay to get in there legitimately.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224505586/" title='Oranised tours, not truely "abandoned" anymore by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr'><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5525/11224505586_8ede3a76f0_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt='Oranised tours, not truely "abandoned" anymore' class="img-responsive"><br><em>Oranised tours, not truely &#8220;abandoned&#8221; anymore</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The tour was in German, and boy did they have a lot of information/stories/something to share. Each time we&#8217;d stop somewhere the guide would talk for like 20 minutes, and to be honest the first two places we stopped weren&#8217;t intrinsically interesting or photogenic, so all of the non-German speakers started to drift off further along to get a sneak peak until eventually I was no longer &#8220;just a bit ahead&#8221; but instead I was off exploring by myself proper the way I really wanted to do it anyway.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224485935/" title="Autumn pathway to the mossy queue for the flume ride by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3809/11224485935_a3f542919f_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Autumn pathway to the mossy queue for the flume ride" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Autumn pathway to the mossy queue for the flume ride</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something vibe killing about being in a group of 40 people at somewhere &#8220;abandoned&#8221;, so I was very happy to get lost and find myself in parts of the park where I couldn&#8217;t see or hear another person. The one sounds were the wind, the birds and the creaking of the old Ferris wheel as the wind made it turn. Very eery!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224549924/" title="Creepy old ferris wheel, turning in the wind by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5505/11224549924_0703b8d854_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Creepy old ferris wheel, turning in the wind" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Creepy old ferris wheel, turning in the wind</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>One security guy was still doing laps of the park on a bike, but I managed to avoid him for the most part. The one time I did get spotted by him I was actually near some other people, and because we had the tour passes on he just friendlily herded us back to the tour group. That pass was pretty much a get out of jail free card! Soon enough I wandered off again to explore without the herd.</p>

<p>There was an old flume ride, now with the track mostly full of leaves.</p>

<p>Crazy old cars on rails made to look like faces, with various moustaches.</p>

<p>Sad and busted up old dinosaurs, fallen over and missing limbs.</p>

</p>

<p>There were swan boats that had managed to free themselves from the tyranny of their traditional canals, now floating free next to pirate ships.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224573566/" title="The swan boats actually float, for realsy by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2819/11224573566_7006630e53_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The swan boats actually float, for realsy" class="img-responsive"><br><em>The swan boats actually float, for realsy</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>This lonely old couch, left to rot in the middle of an old market square, would have some good stories to tell about how it even got there.</p>

</p>

<p>There were the rotting cabinets of old arcade machines, long ago fallen over in the not-very-water-tight food court.</p>

</p>

<p>There was a roller coaster, complete with giant rainbow dragon-face tunnel.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224593885/" title="Big scary rollercoaster face by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3791/11224593885_bd7579b2f8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Big scary rollercoaster face" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Big scary rollercoaster face</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>Every single bridge I could find to the island with the wheel on it had rotten through and collapsed, so I never did get to see the base of it.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224658656/" title="Another collapsed bridge.

</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always intrigued by the final series of events when a place gets abandoned. Did they know at the time that they weren&#8217;t going to return, or was it just closing for a short period? How did all the swan boats get out of their canal? Where were all they dinosaurs originally, and why?</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224795935/" title="Eery lit up booth at the entrance by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2821/11224795935_9777def6ed_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Eery lit up booth at the entrance" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Eery lit up booth at the entrance</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>So many questions that will never be answers, but so many beautiful examples of a place being reclaimed by entropy and nature.</p>

<p>As usual, there are lots more images in the full galleries on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153541824110274.1073741849.876765273&type=1&l=d02a09c700">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/sets/72157638384420535/">Flickr</a>.</p>

      <p>As we approached Rwanda, the terrain started getting a lot more hilly than that of Uganda. We got to the border and queued up to hand in our passports and get our visa, all the while with locals trying to cut in line. I got given some minor grief over not having printed out the acceptance letter for my visa. I did have it in digital form and the letter has a giant bar code that one would assume they’d scan, but apparently it’s easier to put bar codes on letters than it is to put bar code scanners at the border.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914653853/" title="Welcome to the republic of Rwanda by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7305/10914653853_b847da95c6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Welcome to the republic of Rwanda" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Welcome to the republic of Rwanda</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>This was our single slowest border crossing, taking over 90 minutes to get some simple ink stamp &#8220;visas&#8221; put in our passports. Most of the truck was starving by the time we finally got our passports back, but there was still more driving to do before we arrived in Ruhengeri and stopped to make lunch. We were staying in dorm rooms so nobody had to put up tents for a change!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The next morning we were all up early for the big day, gorilla trekking! We were all ready to go well before the sun was up. I&#8217;d woken to hear heavy rain during the night which had me a bit concerned about what the weather might be like but once the sun came up the weather stabilised as just mostly overcast.</p>

<p>The gorillas are only allowed one hour of visiting time per day, during which a group of a maximum of 8 people can come and see them. I think there was something like 10 groups of gorillas that tourists are allowed to trek to see, which means only about 80 people get to experience this on any given day. During the rest of the day there are people employed to track them from a distance to keep an eye on them and protect them from poachers until quite late at night, coming back again early in the morning to figure out where they have moved to.</p>

<p>We started with a very bumpy 40 minute drive to a village where the trek to our gorilla group began, from where we walked for another 40 or so minutes through farms, up the hill to the start of the national park and the mountain jungle.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914352185/" title="Walking through the village by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2833/10914352185_441f03a626_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Walking through the village" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Walking through the village</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>Our guide was apparently the best in Rwanda and had won an award to prove it. He later told us that he&#8217;s taken Bill Gates and his family trekking the gorillas, along with some other famous people I didn&#8217;t recognise. He had a very over-the-top level of enthusiasm that I thought felt pretty insincere, but as the day went on though, either I warmed up to him, or he started to drop the act and began behaving more genuinely; maybe it was just too early in the morning enough sleep?</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914498114/" title="Our guide showing us how gorillas sometimes eat eucalyptus by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5515/10914498114_f61ace7245_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Our guide showing us how gorillas sometimes eat eucalyptus" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Our guide showing us how gorillas sometimes eat eucalyptus</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>In addition to our guide we had some armed escorts, I like to think they were there to protect us from the wildlife, but it&#8217;s also possible they were there to protect us from guerrillas from Congo. Eek!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914496524/" title="Walking up the hill through farms by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7305/10914496524_e935218b49_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Walking up the hill through farms" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Walking up the hill through farms</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>Along the way our guide spotted a chameleon, the first one I&#8217;ve ever seen. It was very cool to see to see it move it&#8217;s eyes independently and a whole lot smaller than I had expected. I always thought they were quite large, but all the ones we saw were tiny. It also turns out they take quite a while to change colour, so even though a few of us got to have him walk along our arms we didn&#8217;t get to see him change colour.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914509344/" title="Chameleon! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5497/10914509344_14ab642bee_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chameleon!" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Chameleon!</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>After another 40 more minutes of trekking up along a fairly well established path through the national park we were finally near enough to where the gorillas were to go &#8220;off path&#8221;. The forest around this point was extremely thick scrub consisting largely of stinging nettles, which were hacked and slashed at with machetes to make a narrow path for us. I can tell you for certain now that stinging nettles are able to sting through right through denim. If you&#8217;re ever doing this trek I&#8217;d highly recommend getting some gaiters to protect your legs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914527274/" title="Into the thicker scrub by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2882/10914527274_d5b4ce72f6_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Into the thicker scrub" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Into the thicker scrub</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We followed the newly slashed path for about 10 minutes before we sighted our first gorilla off in the distance.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914394185/" title="First gorilla sighting by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7354/10914394185_d517bb0755_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="First gorilla sighting" class="img-responsive"><br><em>First gorilla sighting</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>It was quite a long way off but everyone was instantly pretty excited, but we were hurried along by the guide. Suddenly we look to our left and there&#8217;s another gorilla right next to us, probably only 3-4 meters away at most. He&#8217;s there just chilling, eating stuff. He looks over at us briefly but then goes back to chewing and ignoring us.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914448356/" title="Gorilla noticing there are guests by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5534/10914448356_9e4b285023_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Gorilla noticing there are guests" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Gorilla noticing there are guests</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We continue on into the scrub and found a few more sitting around eating.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914547334/" title="Gorilla eating by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5492/10914547334_090a07c919_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Gorilla eating" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Gorilla eating</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We then came across the silverback of the group and got a few distant photos before he moved on.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914746563/" title="Scratching by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3685/10914746563_c6372c09e3_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Big boss scratching" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Big boss scratching</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>A mother gorilla with its baby came walking right towards us; we stood still as we had been instructed to do and they walked right past me, actually brushing against me. It was magical to be in such close proximity to such powerful creatures and have them seem to completely unfazed by our presence.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914449615/" title="Baby going for a ride by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3745/10914449615_45e4a3c181_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Baby going for a ride" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Baby going for a ride</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We followed them to where they were going and found 8 gorillas lazing together. A few of them were grooming one another, while the silverback was lying back with his legs spread, a very dignified position for the big boss.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914782213/" title="What are you looking at? by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2847/10914782213_0f52e37ed9_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="What are you looking at?" class="img-responsive"><br><em>What are you looking at?</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The little baby was here as well, climbing all over the others, falling down, and rolling down the hill. So very cute.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914794413/" title="Band of gorillas by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2835/10914794413_814759ed4d_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Band of gorillas" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Band of gorillas</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We found the &#8220;Vice president&#8221; silverback off to the side with one of the females, apparently trying to get her to &#8220;service him&#8221; while the big boss wasn&#8217;t looking. Very naughty!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914628894/" title="The vice president by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/10914628894_b7f9f27e3d_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The vice president" class="img-responsive"><br><em>The vice president</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>I&#8217;m told we saw every gorilla from the group we trekked to, 18 in total, although with them moving around during our visit I didn&#8217;t even attempt to count them for myself. It was definitely a very special experience that I feel quite privileged to have been able to take part in. It&#8217;s easily sitting at No. 1 on my list of best things I&#8217;ve gotten to see or do so far and I&#8217;d highly recommend it to anyone who has the chance.</p>

</p>

<p>After our hour was up we had to leave and start the very long walk back to the jeeps, along which we found lots more chameleons on the walk back, some of them extremely tiny and in a variety of colours!</p>

</p>

<p>Once we got back to camp we spent the afternoon consuming some well earned celebratory beers.</p>

<p>The following day we made the short drive from Ruhengeri to Kigali through the mountains; it was Amazing to see how steep the land some of the farmers were utilizing was. I&#8217;ve never seen crops growing on such steep land every before!</p>

<p>We stopped in to have a look around Hotel Des Mille Collines, the actual hotel that the Hotel Rwanda story was based on. It was pretty surreal to think of the 1000s of refuges holed up in there while people just outside the fences that wanted to kill them. Today it&#8217;s all so modern and ritzy which it hard to comprehend that it&#8217;s the same place.</p>

</p>

<p>Next stop was the Kigali Genocide Museum which was incredibly educational, with great coverage of the atrocities that went on in Rwanda during those 100 days in 1993, and a exhibition upstairs covered another 5 genocides: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide">The Armenian genocide</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia">Cambodia under the Khemer Rouge</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_Genocide">The  Namibian Genocide</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War">Kosovo</a>. Some of these I&#8217;d known about and others I had no idea. Humans can be such horrible creatures.</p>

<p>The most chilling thing I learned was that the number of UN troops involved in the evacuation of UN personal from Rwanda would have been enough to have stopped the genocide, and yet they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>To get back to Nairobi from Rwanda meant three or four long drive days, back-to-back, punctuated with a few interesting stops.</p>

<p>The first night we stopped at Lake Mburo for a night of camping on the side of the lake, full of hippos. That evening while making dinner we have a number of very bold warthogs come sniffing around in the camp kitchen, only to be shoo&#8217;ed off back Mash swinging a chair at them. Cheeky buggers!</p>

</p>

<p>Finally on our 4th and final land crossing of the Equator we stopped for lunch and were able to take some photos.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10915435514/" title="Equator excitment by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5535/10915435514_2a3d23bc75_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Equator excitment" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Equator excitment</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We were stopped by police as we went through Nakuru, who insisted we were speeding even though there are speed bumps on the road every 100 meters or so. We were forced to go to the police station with the cop to &#8220;sort it out&#8221;. It was another of those times when a bribe is going to be faster, cheaper and easier than following official process which would have required showing up in court with the possibility of a $1000 fine, so again we paid another $300 bribe in Kenya.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10915525134/" title="The cop who claimed we were speeding by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5510/10915525134_6237f2a1ef_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="The cop who claimed we were speeding" class="img-responsive"><br><em>The cop who claimed we were speeding</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>While at the police station, other overland trucks started showing up, all faced with the same accusations. The level of corruption in Kenya leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but on the up-side, someone on the truck was really sick, and this unplanned stop gave them a chance to visit a travel clinic and get fixed up.</p>

<p>I chose to go mountain biking in Hell&#8217;s Gate National Park, one of the parks that the Lion King is said to take inspiration from. It&#8217;s a stunning place to see, with lots of spectacular cliffs and canyons.</p>

</p>

<p>We left the bikes to venture down into the gorge which involved walking along next to some quite big drops, but it was worth it to get to see down the bottom.</p>

</p>

<p>When we finally made it back to Nairobi, a few of us went to visit the Giraffe sanctuary, where you could feed a giraffe from your mouth so it looked like they were giving you a kiss.</p>

</p>

<p>For out last evening in Africa we went and hung out with Pete and Deb one last time at the apartment they had rented. It was a lovely relaxed evening of pizza, drinks, and nature documentaries. Those two are total champions, so lovely and hospitable. I will definitely need to make a trip to Sydney to visit them one day when I&#8217;m finally back in Australia.</p>

</p>

<p>We headed to the airport after midnight for our flight to Turkey, which left at 3:45am. I was so tired that I slept sitting upright in a plastic chair, and when I was finally on the plane and I was asleep again before takeoff.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to put into words what it&#8217;s like out on the streets of Africa. They&#8217;re like no other place I&#8217;ve been. Towards the end of the trip I started taking a LOT of photos out the window in the hope it might capture even just a small fraction of the weird and wonderful things you see out the truck window. Click the photo to go to the full flickr set. Feel free to be distracted, and not notice that I haven&#8217;t posted about gorillas yet too :P</p>

      Uganda - White Water Rafting, Tracking Chimps and Teaching Orphans

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>After crossing into Uganda our first stop was Jinja, the second largest city in Uganda and its unofficial extreme sports capital. We had a free day here to do whatever activities took our fancy; some people went and played mini-golf, some went and played regular golf, but I opted for white water rafting down the White Nile.</p>

<p>All up there was seven people from our Dragoman group who went along, who with our American guide Tyler made up a full raft of people. We got taken to the &#8220;put in&#8221; point where we were given some breakfast, sorted out with high-flotation life vests and paddles and then were led down to our raft for some basic training, which involved things like paddling in time, turning, getting down low in the raft, flipping the raft and climbing back in. It was all pretty straightforward stuff and the water was a lovely refreshing temperature. A lot of people struggled to get back into the raft unassisted, but I surprised myself by being one of the ones who could! I can&#8217;t even do a single chin up, but I guess climbing back into a raft probably uses a lot of the same muscles that I built up last year being stuck on crutches for nearly 6 months.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10421378166/" title="Our rafting group by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/10421378166_c1c6dd755d_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Our rafting group" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Our rafting group</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The first rapid of the day was one of the most fun and memorable ones, it was basically a three metre waterfall drop off, followed closely by two more pools of rapids. We went down the waterfall, which felt like a theme park flume log ride on steroids, then paddled as hard as we could for the bigger pool of rapids but the current was too strong and we ended up going down the less turbulent path.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10421394005/" title="IMG_9312.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/10421394005_3e123c7a49_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Weeeeeeeee!" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Weeeeeeeee!</em></a></p>
</a></p>
White water rapids are rated on a grading scale from one to five, with five being the biggest rapids, and we were told that all of the rapids we were going through that day would be between grade three to five. Perfect for someone like me who&#8217;s never done it before :) It&#8217;s not actually as scary as it sounds, because the White Nile river flow is very high volume, that means the rapids are really big, but they&#8217;re also really deep so there&#8217;s much less chance of coming into contact with rocks. Lots more exciting and safer to boot!</p>

</a></p>
During the day we went through eight rapids in total, and having never been rafting before I was a bit surprised how much calm floating down the river was involved between most of them. When after the first two rapids Tyler told us we had about 45 minutes until the next rapid I initially thought he was joking. There was plenty of opportunities for us to jump in the river and just float along next to the raft.</p>

<p>On the third rapid of the day the water surged right as we got into the biggest part of the rapid and flipped the whole raft. Finding myself suddenly underwater like that for the first time, I instantly forgot everything we were told about holding onto paddle and lost it right away. I tried to surface but kept coming up under the raft and its baffles. I started to panic a bit, but managed to calm myself down and realise that I can easily hold my breath for more than a few seconds, so I held my breath and fumbled my way to one of the sides of the raft and grabbed onto the rope. I struggled to keep my head above water while we were still in the rapids, but once we were past them it there was a pretty awesome wave of feeling alive!</p>

</a></p>
I think pretty much everyone else who was doing it for the first time had similar experiences, many lost paddles were retrieved for us by the safety canoe guys.</p>

<p>We were told how a dam that was built two years earlier has changed the river a lot. None of the old rapids still exist, and new ones have formed. We&#8217;re told that it used to be the best white water rafting rapids in the world before the dam was built, the &#8220;put in&#8221; used to be at the actual campsite that we were staying at, but now the river running past that area is significantly deeper and there&#8217;s no rapids along there at all, hence having to drive 40 minutes in the morning. I still thought it was fantastic fun, but it would have been great to be able to compare it to how it used to be.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10421438276/" title="IMG_9401.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/10421438276_96ded49a0f_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Riding the waves" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Riding the waves</em></a></p>
</a></p>
On the last rapid of the day we were told that if we didn&#8217;t get flipped anyway, Tyler would give the ok and we could all jump out into the surging white water if we wanted to. It was an awesome feeling being in the tumultuous water, this time being well clear of the boat. It felt like being in a giant washing machine, with the water dragging you in every direction, rapidly one after another. It really gave you an appreciation for the raw power of the river.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10421446195/" title="IMG_9427.jpg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2853/10421446195_ed5faa99a5_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Everyone made it back in one piece" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Everyone made it back in one piece</em></a></p>
</a></p>
Next point of interest was in the Budongo forest, where we went in with guides to track the chimpanzees that live there. The group was split in two since only 12 people are allowed in the forest at once, which was further split into two groups of 6 with a guide each. I thought that the forest felt quite a lot like the Australian rainforest around the area where I grew up on the Far North Coast of NSW.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10440627725/" title="Chimp tracking by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/10440627725_849ae02d38_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Chimp tracking" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Chimp tracking</em></a></p>
</a></p>
Not long after entering the forest we heard chimp sounds off in the distance, and saw several fresh nests that they apparently make to sleep in at night and use only once. After walking for a while longer we heard more chimp calls coming from behind us and realised we&#8217;d passed them somehow.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10440748163/" title="Chimpanzees walking off in the distance by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2851/10440748163_d2eea2231e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chimpanzees walking off in the distance" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Chimpanzees walking off in the distance</em></a></p>
</a></p>
We headed back and found 6-7 chimps walking along one of the tracks away from us, one carrying a baby on it&#8217;s back. One of them split off from the group and we got to watch it climb up a tree and eat some sort of fruit, dropping the seeds down just in front of us.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10440595526/" title="Chimp eating up a tree by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5542/10440595526_4c504a7dae_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chimp eating up a tree" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Chimp eating up a tree</em></a></p>
</a></p>
We tracked down another one that was just sitting on the forest floor who seemed to be having something to eat and generally lazing about in the sun and spent quite a while watching.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10440763863/" title="Chimp lazing in the sun by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/10440763863_c8915a30ca_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Chimp lazing in the sun" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Chimp lazing in the sun</em></a></p>
</a></p>
The forest was generally too thick and we were too far away to get great unobstructed photos, but it was really cool to get to see the chimpanzees in their natural habitat, with some of their movements and behaviours seeming so close to human.</p>

<p>The next place of note was Queen Elizabeth the Second National Park. We went on a game drive here and saw some lions and gazelles and stuff, but nothing as cool as what we&#8217;d already seen. At one point we stopped in a village in the park by the lake, and got out to have a closer look at some hippos near the shore. Steve warned us not to get too close, but didn&#8217;t specify how close. The general consensus was that &#8220;inside a hippo&#8221; was probably too close, but otherwise people were pretty fearless going right up to the edge of the water.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10440658854/" title="Hippo foot print by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7333/10440658854_472cded8e8_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Hippo foot print" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Hippo foot print</em></a></p>
</a></p>
The highlight for us was a sunset cruise which closely followed along one bank of the river (o channel between two lakes? I&#8217;m not certain). It was probably the most densely packed period of animal watching we got to do all trip. We saw countless hippos and tons of exotic birds, crocodiles, buffalo and countless other critters.</p>

</a></p>
We saw one hippo &#8220;mark its territory&#8221; by pooping while helicopter-ing it&#8217;s tail around, with bits flying everywhere. An interesting technique to say the least.</p>

</a></p>
There were lots of old male buffalo, sitting in the water that had apparently been chased away from their herds by the younger, stronger males. This is sort of like retirement for them, although they can sometimes force their way back into a herd.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10440781995/" title="Retired buffalo by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/10440781995_6735f21dfc_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Retired buffalo" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Retired buffalo</em></a></p>
</a></p>
And we got to see lots of hippo yawns, enough to actually get a decent &#8220;postcard&#8221; photo at last!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10440808526/" title="Giant hippo yawn by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/10440808526_c3fd515635_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Giant hippo yawn" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Giant hippo yawn</em></a></p>
</a></p>
At camp that night there were a lot of hippos running around at night and eating near the tents, waking people up and terrifying them. I think I heard some noises off in the distance as I was getting to sleep, but being a heavy sleeper I managed to miss most of the commotion.</p>

<p>The last stop for us in Uganda (for this entry at least), was at Lake Bunyonyi where we stayed at a very scenic camp ground next to a very large and interesting lake. It has nearly 30 islands, its surface is nearly 2000 metres above sea level, and it&#8217;s stupidly deep. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Bunyonyi">Wikipedia says it&#8217;s rumoured to be between 44 metres (which seems like it should be shallow enough to prove or disprove) and 900 meters (now we&#8217;re talking!)</a>. The was a sign on the bank that claims it&#8217;s 6,500 feet deep, or about 2000 meters, and since Wikipedia only lists &#8220;rumoured depths&#8221;, I&#8217;m going with that since the sign is more of a citation than the Wikipedia page has.</p>

</a></p>
While there we went on a little tour though a local village, where we met a woman that our local guide described as &#8220;a crazy old lady&#8221; that didn&#8217;t speak a word of English, but was very excited to meet everyone, giving everyone a squeeze on the butt, women got a good boob squeeze and men with beards got a stroking. The whole thing was very amusing.</p>

</a></p>
We also visited a school for orphans between 3-8 years old, run by <a href="http://www.littleangelsuganda.org/">Little Angels Uganda</a>. We sat in on a class doing lessons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and spelling. We even got to get up do a bit of teaching ourselves, and nearly everything that happened in the class was followed by a song all the kids sang: &#8220;(name), you&#8217;re so good and precious&#8221;. It was pretty adorable.</p>

</a></p>
After class there was more singing and dancing out in the playground, largely led by a very confident little girl with a good sense of rhythm. The kids seemed quite curious about my beard, which led to me being picked to go into their circle to try and dance along with them, showing the world that I have zero rhythm :P</p>

</p>

<p>We then helped serve up some lunch for the children consisting of bread, bananas, rice, porridge, and orange drink. During lunch the teachers ran a sort of spelling bee, where if the kids spelt our words they got an extra piece of fruit. Seemed like a good motivator for learning.</p>

</p>

<p>We made our way back to camp in dugout canoes, which felt like they might flip at any moment. I have to admit I feared a bit for my electronics until I was standing on land again.</p>

</p>

<p>That last night in Uganda we set up a mini-cinema around Steve&#8217;s laptop and watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395169/">Hotel Rwanda</a>, which is almost like an African Schindler&#8217;s list. I&#8217;ll admit my knowledge of the full extent of what happened in Rwanda way back when I was a child was pretty lacking, having a bit of context the night before we were crossing into Rwanda worked out perfectly for me.</p>

<p>The next day we were headed on to Rwanda for the trip highlight, tracking the mountain gorillas, but you&#8217;ll probably have to wait months to read about that at the rate I&#8217;m going writing this stuff up :P Also, if you&#8217;re interested there&#8217;s loads more photos for each blog post up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/sets">Flickr</a> (and Facebook), but these posts are probably already way too photo-heavy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>So after leaving Tanzania we were destined for Kenya to visit the Masai Mara, however we ran into a bit of trouble actually getting into Kenya. Everyone&#8217;s visa got sorted out nice and quickly, but there was some sort of hold up involving the truck. Something to do with the truck&#8217;s registration being changed over from English to Namibian and us not having the right <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnet_de_Passages">Carnet de Passage</a> to go with it.</p>

<p>To make better use of the time we set up the kitchen to make lunch there at the border, then after eating some of the group started having a game of cricket! The spectacle drew a small crowd of truck drivers watching, and trying to catch the long shots that went their way.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124599493/" title="Cricket game at the Kenyan border by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5530/10124599493_a523f7caf6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Border cricket" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Border cricket</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>After a while Steve filled us in on things, apparently the registration was changed over a long time ago and the truck had been in and out of Kenya a bunch of times since then, but in the book they had always written down the old registration details, but because the border officials are so damn ethical they couldn&#8217;t do that again for us this time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There were three options that Steve thought might get us out of our pickle:</p>

<ol>
<li>We leave the truck and sort out other transport to Nairobi, and then hope the Carnet gets sorted out while we&#8217;re in the Masai Mara (using smaller safari Land Cruisers again).</li>
<li>We pay a bond for the value of the truck, but apparently bond in Kenya don&#8217;t work like real bonds; it&#8217;s basically sunk money that you will never get back. Luckily the truck is on the books as being only worth $4k, instead of the probably 100K+ it would truly be worth. Still not a great option, we would need to dip into the kitty to cover it.</li>
<li>We pay a bribe to get them to make the entry in the book with the old registration, like every other time.</li>
</ol>


<p>Eventually  after about 2 hours, we were able to pay a bribe of a few hundred dollars to get the paperwork fudged by that same very ethical and totally not corrupt border official. The bribe actually had to be negotiated by our Kenyan cook Charles, because the border officials were scared of dealing with Steve,  a white guy who can look mighty pissed off when he&#8217;s not happy, and he really wasn&#8217;t happy.</p>

<p>And so, from the very start we were exposed to the best of Kenyan corruption, and it wouldn&#8217;t be our last bribe in Kenyan either!</p>

</p>

<p>The traffic coming into Nairobi was super congested; it took us hours to go what was probably only 20 kms. So slow in fact, and with nowhere to stop the truck, that someone on board could hold it no longer and needed to pee in a bucket! Fun times!</p>

<p>We stopped at Galleria shopping center to shop for supplies and buy some dinner in. My first impression of the Kenya based on this mall was that it&#8217;s a lot like South Africa. Everything seemed clean and modern, and generally much more developed than anywhere we went in Tanzania. It turned out however that a shopping mall is not very representative of a country; who would have thought it?!</p>

<p>The next morning we again left the truck behind and split up into safari 4WDs, this time with our whole Melbourne crew &#8220;Team Toto&#8221; in the same vehicle! Things were actually pretty disorganised, our driver didn&#8217;t even know he was driving that day so he showed up quite late and had to stop to meet his wife along the way to get some clothes for the trip.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124579975/" title="We care for your fillings by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2876/10124579975_c374892245_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="We care for your fillings, but not enough to actually have diesel" class="img-responsive"><br><em>We care for your fillings, but not enough to actually have diesel</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>After a few hours drive we stopped in a small town near the Masai Mara to fuel up with diesel, expect every single service station in town was bone dry. We were actually pretty lucky in that we only waited for 2 hours for one of the stations to get refueled; Apparently the car at the front of the line had been waiting 2 days for fuel!</p>

</p>

<p>The road leading into the Masai Mara was a very poorly maintained dirt road, bumpy to the point where it just felt like we were driving over huge corrugations. That certainly didn&#8217;t mean we had to drive along it slowly though, all the Land Cruisers flew along it at 90-100 km/h and feeling like we going to fly off the road at any moment. It probably didn&#8217;t help that our Land Cruiser was 30 years old and felt like the suspension was all the original parts that came fitted on the car when it rolled off the lot. :P</p>

<p>At one point we slowed down to a stop, our driver spoke with another driver for a bit and then let us know that the brakes had failed. Excellent! We went to continue anyway but then the car wouldn&#8217;t start and we needed a push to get going again, thankfully a whole lot slower now that we weren&#8217;t able to stop ourselves.</p>

<p>We drove to the park gate where they sorted out a replacement vehicle for us to go off in that afternoon while they got our one fixed up, so we didn&#8217;t entirely miss our afternoon game drive.</p>

<p>Now if your thinking, &#8220;Gee, that sounds like a pretty shitty day&#8221; you&#8217;d be right at this point. So many things had gone wrong up till now that I felt like I would have been happy to just go to camp and forget the game drive, but I&#8217;m incredibly glad we ended up going because those 1-2 hours in the park that afternoon completely salvaged an otherwise terrible day and left us in great spirits for the evening!</p>

<p>We drove straight in to where a lot of cars were following a leopard that was walking around near some bushland. It felt a bit like a circus with so many cars circled around with so little respect for the animals personal space. Where in the Serengeti the drivers stick to the roads and you get to see what you can see from there, in the Masai Mara it&#8217;s a free for all and they drive you right up to things, and the moment the animal moves so so all the vehicles in order to stay right up close. We pulled up probably only 2-3 meters away from the leopard, which honestly felt like we were getting way too close, but it made for some fantastic photos. It did mean that when the leopard glared in our direction, it really felt like it could just jump in the vehicle and kill the lot of us if it chose to.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124707306/" title="and then we got up way way closer by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/10124707306_10ffa35a4d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Leopard, not so happy to see us" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Leopard, not so happy to see us</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>After the leopard got fed up with the circus and went into hiding we raced off and very briefly saw a cheetah sitting in too long a grass to really see much, so then we shot off again to see 2 lionesses &amp; 6 cubs playing. Again we got right up close, front row seats, and turned the engines off. Up that close in near silence it was possible to forget the media circus that you were part of and really just enjoy watching the lion cubs play. It was beautiful!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124891973/" title="Daaaaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/10124891973_e3d21f0b50_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="So cute!" class="img-responsive"><br><em>So cute!</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>After about 15 minutes, all of the circus suddenly started their engines and we all raced away back to the road. Our driver told us that they&#8217;d heard that park rangers were on there way over and we wanted to get away without getting a &#8220;big fine&#8221; of 10,000 Kenyan Shillings, or about USD$120.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124756964/" title="Lion cubs playing by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7303/10124756964_3a689d5a17_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The family portrait" class="img-responsive"><br><em>The family portrait</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The penalties for venturing off the roads are significantly lower in Kenya compared to Tanzania. In Tanzania the drivers would loose their licence as well as get a large fine, and hence be unable to work anymore, so in Tanzania everyone stays on the road. But in Kenya there&#8217;s only the monetary penalty which they just pass on to the customers anyway, which is why they&#8217;re willing to break the rules and go way off-road in the Masai Mara.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124824455/" title="Lion cubs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7390/10124824455_ef91488097_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Baby cubs!" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Baby cubs!</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in two minds about the whole thing. On one hand it made the place feel a lot more zoo like, or that we were all just a part of some horrible media paparazzi, and if our driver had stayed back on the road it would only really be disadvantaging ourselves because no-one else was and they&#8217;d all get in the way of us seeing anything at all. But on the other hand it felt incredibly special getting up so close the animals, and as Steve pointed out, it&#8217;s been like this for so long that the animals have never known it any differently so they&#8217;re not at all phased by the cars.</p>

<p>Back at the campsite we happily drank some beers and recounted all the cool stuff we&#8217;d seen that afternoon and you would never have even known that it was the same day where all that stuff went wrong! The campsite had permanent tents for us to stay in so we didn&#8217;t even have to set up tents that night, a huge luxury for us!</p>

<p>The next morning we were up early to get in the gate as soon as the park opened, on a hunt to find more big cats and the shining sun made for a great day for just that. From a long way away we spotted a lioness trying to hunt a bird and failing miserably, but it was actually really close to where the lions were the day before, so we headed over to investigate.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124907475/" title="Big male lion by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7451/10124907475_6eab63bbb4_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Big male lion" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Big male lion</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>Once we were closer we found a big male lion just sitting, being all majestic in the sun, and over behind him there were 2 lionesses eating and occasionally fighting over some sort of animal carcass.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124854754/" title="Fighting over food by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7333/10124854754_6fcd11147b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lionesses fighting over food" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Lionesses fighting over food</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>All of a sudden the females stopped what they were doing and stared in our direction. I was thinking, &#8220;Shit, what have we done? They look mean and are probably going to eat us now&#8221; but it turned out they were looking past us. A long way past us in fact, where probably 1000 meters away there was a large herd of wildebeests. At first none of us thought they could actually be what they had stopped so suddenly over, but then one lioness and the lion set off down a gully that separated us from the herd and then reappeared on the other side and continued towards them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124989066/" title="and then suddenly: DEATH STARE by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/10124989066_37500dc7ce_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="Wildebeest herd spotted" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Wildebeest herd spotted</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We sped off the long way around the gully and then follow the two lions as they chased the heard and split it in two, then changed targets and chased after a different herd several more times, but never actually making an attack while we were watching.</p>

</p>

</p>

<p>We gave up on seeing those two hunt and ventured back to see what the others were doing, and we find 2 other lionesses with the cubs with at least 2 dying wildebeests in the large grassy plain, both still occasionally kicking.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125168873/" title="Finishing off a wildebeest by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5457/10125168873_0267f56587_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Finishing off a wildebeest" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Finishing off a wildebeest</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The lions were all focused on one wildebeest, and the circus of cars circled around to watch the lions and sort of gave the other wildebeest some cover. After several attempts it somehow managed to get back on its feet and tried to make a break for it, but somehow even through all the vehicles the lions spotted it and chased it down again to kill it. Sadly we missed the crucial moment because other cars pull in and obscured our view, but we did get to see the very end of the predation with the lion going for the wildebeest&#8217;s neck.</p>

</p>

<p>We drove a long way further into the park, well away from the thick swaths of vans that you don&#8217;t seem to be able to get away from near the main gate and saw plenty of cool small stuff and big stuff. An baby giraffe and it&#8217;s mum, hippos lazing in the river while crocodiles slept on the bank.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125219283/" title="Mother and baby giraffe by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/10125219283_ede21a9e64_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Mother and baby giraffe" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Mother and baby giraffe</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>It seemed like we had probably seen all the big cats we were going to see that day, as they normally like to laze around in the sun in the warm afternoons, but today we got luck and saw even more cats in the afternoon!</p>

<p>We noticed a lone car quite a long way from the road and went over to investigate and were pleasantly surprised to find four cheetah on sitting around a rock, and as we pulled up the other car left and it was just us and the cheetahs! It was marvelous, but being the only car there made our driver nervous (much more likely to be fined when you&#8217;re breaking the rules by yourself I guess) so we only stayed for a few minutes.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125289036/" title="Cheetahs! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/10125289036_d7c5ebb5b2_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Cheetahs chilling" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Cheetahs chilling</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We went back to see what another car from out group was looking at and arrived just as another pair of cheetahs disappeared into the long grass! Our drivers had a discussion and we turned around to take the other car back to see our four cheetahs, and boy am I glad we did!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125368553/" title="Cheetahs! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2810/10125368553_df672cf4d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Cheetah close up" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Cheetah close up</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>When we got back there they had moved a bit further on and looked to be staring quite intently at something in the distance. We spotted a lone warthog and got excited that we might get to see some hunting, and sure enough two or three of the cheetahs started running towards it. But to our surprise, suddenly a whole lot of grass started to rustle and we could suddenly see  there was a whole pack of warthogs that were suddenly running for their lives!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125304546/" title="Cheetahs! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7347/10125304546_a6e69a6038_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Cheetah hunting" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Cheetah hunting</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The cheetahs managed to split one off from the pack and we were sure one of them chasing a lone warthog was going to get it, but in a split second the warthog went into long grass and the next thing we saw was like a Benny Hill movie and they were not running in the opposite direction with the warthog chasing the cheetah! I guess he must have remembered that he had bad ass big tusks and could just as easily gut the cheetah as it could chase him down. And so both the warthog and the cheetah both lived to see another day.</p>

<p>On top of the cheetahs, Leigh managed to spot a lion sleeping by the waterhole, as in actually spotted the animal itself as there were no other vehicles around it. It was certainly waaaaaay nicer on these occasions where it felt like it was just us the and animals as opposed to the circus that went on elsewhere</p>

</p>

<p>On our last morning we were up early again for another sunrise game drive, and within about 10 minutes of entering the park we came across an absolutely huge herd of elephants. There must have been at least 40 of them roaming around together. Magical!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125247294/" title="I dont normally post photos of the animals walking away, but it was the only way to get them all in the frame by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/10125247294_3a2e176e14_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Huge elephant herd" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Huge elephant herd</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>After some more driving around we found two bloody mouthed lions eating something they had killed with two small cubs, but they were in quite long grass with a paparazzi of people around them and we&#8217;d seen such awesome lions the day before we ventured on in hope of seeing something better.</p>

<p>We spent most of the morning in search of Rhinos to complete the big five, but unfortunately even after hours of driving we didn&#8217;t seem much beyond the few random carcasses on the side of the road and a few jackal.</p>

</p>

<p>The morning ended with a bit of a kufufle between Steve and the drivers about the game drive ending earlier than it was supposed to, and our driver not putting in the time to go look for some wild dogs one of the other vehicles had spotted. It was a real shame to mar what had been a pretty amazing few days in the Masai Mara by ending this way, but  I guess these things happen.</p>

<p>The drive back out to the bitumen road felt even longer and bumpier and bumpier than the way in and there was a cheer in the car when we were finally back on sealed roads, and could start making better time for the long drive back to Nairobi.</p>

<p>That day marked the end of that leg of the tour, and hence the start of the next leg: The gorilla loop! We were sad to lose some of our truck buddies and our fantastic cook Charles, but there were new people waiting to join us back at camp and our new cook Mash who turned out to be just as much of a wizard in the camp kitchen as Charles was. It was mind blowing the quality of the meals prepared in a kitchen that got setup and packed down into a few plastic tubs every day, and for 25 people each meal too. I have to hand it to Dragoman, they pick their crew very well!</p>

</p>

<p>Some of us went out for dinner at Carnivore, a quite famous restaurant in Nairobi that gained it&#8217;s fame by running an all you can eat grill with all sorts of exotic game meat. The place felt like some sort of movie world-like theme park, with the waiters dressed in very flarey garb and the adjoined night club cranking out loud music, it was very surreal to be at a place that felt like it would fit in well in Hollywood, but to know you were actually in Kenya.</p>

</p>

<p>Unfortunately none of us had done our research very well, and so didn&#8217;t know that Kenya had banned the sale of game meat quite a few years ago, and that the most exotic meats on the menu these days were ostrich and crocodile. They also served lamb, beef, chicken and pork, and a few out of the ordinary offal meats such as ox testicles and chicken liver. For those wondering ox testicles have a very soft, melt in your mouth texture and don&#8217;t taste half bad!</p>

<p>It was a nice night, a very memorable experience, and the meats we got to eat were generally all very tasty, but had I known I wasn&#8217;t going to get to eat wildebeest and zebra I probably would have gone somewhere else.</p>

<p>The next morning we stopped again at the Galleria shops for supplies, where I spent the entirety of my free time dealing with ATM shenanigans, trying to get enough shillings to buy the USD I needed to pay for my trip kitty for this leg of the tour. Every single Automatic ATM Machine (trollololol) in the centre was completely empty, right up until about 10 minutes before we were supposed to meet up after I watched the very long process of filling the ATMs by hand from a big sack of cash.</p>

</p>

<p>I stayed there and maxed out my limit, before rushing back to the truck hoping I wouldn&#8217;t be the last person back that everyone was waiting on. I got lucky and we had some extra time because the driver of the cab that Leigh left his phone in the night before was coming to drop it off. I managed to get to a bank and get it changed to USD and was finally able to pay the remaining part of my trip kitty. Such a huge relief after weeks of screwing about trying to obtain it!</p>

<p>Our next stop was Lake Nakuru, where it was raining quite heavily and the campsite had turned to mud. The truck got well bogged as well pulled in and we needed to get a giant tractor to get it pulled out. We took the easy way out that night and 6 of us upgraded to one of the bungalows instead of dealing with tents that night. Apparently it&#8217;s the rainy season here, which was a shock to us since we were still in the southern hemisphere (ie. Technically winter, although not really cold) and I think most of use though it was going to be dry season everywhere we were going.

<p>We went on another early morning game drive around Lake Nakuru and quickly saw that the heavy rain was not a one-off thing. The lake has been flooding for a long time now and it&#8217;s banks are well broken, apparently there&#8217;s nowhere for the water to drain so it just continues to expand, even blocking of the main entrance into the park. There was quite a large forest near the waters edge that was so waterlogged that most of the trees had just plain fallen over, roots and all, and nearly all the flamingos that the lake is famous for are gone because the algae they come to eat is too deep for them to get to now.</p>

</p>

<p>We saw a heap of black rhinos, they seemed to be everywhere, which completed the big five for everyone who hadn&#8217;t already done so.</p>

</p>

<p>We saw some giraffes play fighting, bashing their necks but quite slowly and gently compared to when they&#8217;re out for blood.</p>

</p>

<p>We found a lion sleeping on a rock.</p>

</p>

<p>But the most memorable part of the morning was the epic bogging that occurred when we tried to pass a large puddle in the road. The first van of our went through  to one side and got stuck. We waited a while and someone came along and gave them a tow out.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125389144/" title="Van one gets bogged by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5331/10125389144_50cb9c6a03_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Van one gets bogged" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Van one gets bogged</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The second van in our convoy went in, the exact same path as the first, and predictably got bogged too.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125401404/" title="Then van two gets bogged by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/10125401404_8a12e64d07_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Then van two gets bogged" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Then van two gets bogged</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>After the drivers had gotten out and wondered how they were going to get the van out, our driver got bored waiting and tried to pass the other side of the puddle. We sped in with the engine redlining, and after a few very aggressive bumps we were out the other side with cheers all round.</p>

<p>Eventually a 4WD by and towed our other van out, so we were all finally past the obstacle, but then the 4WD itself tried to go through the puddle straight through the middle, where unbeknownst to us there was a very, very deep hole, and so it got completely stuck with one wheel floating up in the air. We all got out and sticky-beaked for a while, but since there was nothing we could do to help we went on to finish out game drive.</p>

</p>

<p>After Nakuru we made our way to the Ugandan border, uneventfully crossing the equator by land for the first time with little perceivable change in the weather even though it was now technically summer :P The border crossing into Uganda was much smoother than the on into Kenya, we paid our money, got our stamps and in we went!</p>

      <p>So the main draw card for visiting Tanzania was in fact not to go and laze about Zanzibar, rather it was to go and visit the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, some of Africa&#8217;s best known big game parks.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10000707374/" title="Serengeti official gate by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2831/10000707374_6b3b8cb833_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="The Serengeti" class="img-responsive"><br><em>The Serengeti</em></a></p>
</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We left our overland truck behind and divided off into a number of safari Landrovers with just enough clothing and food for the few days we&#8217;d be in the parks.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10001160445/" title="Safari trucks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5447/10001160445_64e82f1512_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Our safari Land Rovers that you can pop the tops on!" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Our safari Land Rovers that you can pop the tops on!</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>To get into the Serengeti we needed to drive up over the rim of the crater (but not into the crater), past where we would be camping the following night. As we drove up the temperature dropped quite noticeably, and at the top we stopped at a lookout point where there was a pretty spectacular view of the crater. We then descended down another side of the crater and into the Serengeti.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10000698293/" title="Ngorongoro Crater lookout by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/10000698293_a3676eda09_c.jpg" width="800" height="247" alt="The Horizon is not actual this wonky in real life." class="img-responsive"><br><em>The Horizon is not actual this wonky in real life.</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>It had been very dry for quite some time apparently, which meant that vehicles going in and out kicked up heaps and heaps of dusk. A lot of the dirt roads leading up to the Serengeti park entrance was a very rich red, which made some beautiful vistas where you&#8217;d have a very pale green and yellow hill with a dark red line cut through it, with an almost painted looking red gradient fading down wind of the road for 10-15M and a few meters upwind of it. It&#8217;s hard to really describe it well with words, so here&#8217;s a photo!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10000617295/" title="Red dirt roads cut through the landscape by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7361/10000617295_6729fd1697_c.jpg" width="800" height="247" alt="Red dirt roads cut through the landscape" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Red dirt roads cut through the landscape</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>Anyhow, on our first day in the Serengeti we saw a ton of stuff. Not long after we got into the main part of the park we passed 4-5 lions sleeping, which had surprisingly few other vehicles stopped around them. In these parks you often seem to find the big 5 by just looking for the clusters of 4WDs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10001008555/" title="Lions chilling by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7371/10001008555_99051e1051_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lions chilling" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Lions chilling</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>That is actually how we found two leopards sleeping in trees, so far from the road you couldn&#8217;t see them with the naked eye. All the stopped vehicles got us to stop and try and work out what they were looking at, and then through binoculars you could make them out lying in the forks of trees and see their tail hanging down.</p>

</p>

<p>Of course we saw a whole lot of the more common stuff too. We had a small herd of elephants that were approaching the road and walked right passed our Land Rover less than a few meters away. There were several hyenas roaming about, heaps and heaps of Grant&#8217;s and Thompson&#8217;s gazelles, a few heart beasts, and a lot of lovably ugly warthogs.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10002412986/" title="They're coming right for us! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5539/10002412986_65e2c908fe_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Elephants, coming right for us!" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Elephants, coming right for us!</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>That night we actually camped in the Serengeti. They do have dedicated camp areas there, but don&#8217;t get the wrong impression. There are no fences and you really are camping out in the wild. We were instructed to set up out tents with a few meters gap between them, just in case elephants or hippos came through so that they&#8217;d have enough room to pass rather than just walking straight over tents; and not long before bed several people saw a hyena shaped silhouette with lit up eyes from the torchlight. Sadly, being a heavy sleeper, I slept through any animal sounds that may or may not have been made that night.</p>

<p>We were instructed that if we woke up in the middle of the night and heard noises, to just stay in out tents and be quiet, and don&#8217;t turn on any lights. If you need to go to the toilet, hold it. If you cant hold it, wake up your tent buddy, shine a torch outside the tent looking for eyes, then go right there next to the tent while your buddy keeps watch and deal with it in the morning. I was glad to be someone who very rarely needs to get up in the middle of the night!</p>

<p>We were up well before sunrise the next day for one of the major trip highlights, hot air ballooning over the Serengeti! We were collected in 4WDs and driven to the site where they where getting things set up. It was interesting to see how they inflate the balloons with huge fans to start off with the basket on it&#8217;s side. They then squeeze everyone into their compartments while it&#8217;s still on it&#8217;s side and you feel a bit like an astronaut about to blast off to the moon, lying flat to the ground looking up towards the moon in the still dark sky.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014682903/" title="Balloon being inflated by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3717/10014682903_a78b2301be_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="A balloon being fan inflated" class="img-responsive"><br><em>A balloon being fan inflated</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The burners begin getting fired and the balloon slowly rises, eventually tipping the basket upright. The actual take-off was so gentle you don&#8217;t even feel the balloon lift off, just all of a sudden you&#8217;re no longer on the ground and moving. It&#8217;s very surreal very surreal.</p>

</p>

<p>Each balloon held 16 passengers and a pilot, and there were three balloons going up that morning. Our group was 15 people and we ended up getting a balloon to ourselve!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014699263/" title="Hippos by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3775/10014699263_959423357b_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Hippos" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Hippos</em>
</a></p>

<p>During the balloon flight we saw our first hippos of the Serengeti, probably 20-30 of them concentrated in the water and dashing about nearby. From the roads the park feels like a completely flat and dry, yellow savannah; but from the air you see the gashes of green carved through the yellow where the waterways runs through, and there&#8217;s actually quite a lot of animal activity in and around these parts.</p>

</p>

<p>We got to see the sun rise from the air, after which the balloon started casting a nice shadow silhouette on the ground.</p>

</p>
</p></p>

<p>As we flew further over the park we passed over a few lioness&#8217; and one very majestic male lion with a huge big mane who just sort of looked up at us, wondering what the heck we were I guess. I stupidly had my camera recording video so here&#8217;s a photo a friend took:</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10020294715/" title="Male Lion looking up at our ballon by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3827/10020294715_3c7d55e66d_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Photo stolen from " class="img-responsive"><br><em>Photo stolen from </em>
</a></p>

<p>Most of the animals didn&#8217;t seem to pay us much attention although we did manage to startle some buffalo when we were flying quite low, firing the burners caused them to look up suddenly and then dash off a short distance before realising we weren&#8217;t a threat. At one point we were gliding so low that the basket actually skimmed over the top of an Acacia.</p>

</p>

<p>Just as we were landing we spotted a hyena chasing down a gazelle. Everyone was pretty disappointed to be told we had to get back into the take off position for safety, where we were unable to keep watching. The landing was very smooth; not quite as unnoticeable as the take off, but still hardly a bump or drag along the ground and we were stopped on the ground, upright and everything. Our pilot had mad skills!</p>

</p>

<p>Upon landing we had a Champagne breakfast and were told the entertaining story about French ballooning pioneers, which rather than reinterpret I&#8217;ll quote here:</p>

<p class="excerpt">The creation of the hot air balloon dates back to the 1700s, and the first flight occurred on Oct. 19, 1783 in France.</p>




<p class="excerpt">In 18th century France, there were educated people living in the city and there were landowners and peasants in the country. People in the rural areas often had little contact and connection to what was going on in the city.</p>




<p class="excerpt">So, picture this, you are a peasant working in the fields and all of the sudden you see this balloon floating through the air with fire coming out of it. Is it an alien? An attacker? For peasants who hadn’t heard of hot air ballooning,  the sight of a balloon falling from the sky surprised and often frightened them; especially when they saw the pilot’s face covered in black from ash and soot from the fire keeping the balloon aloft.</p>




<p class="excerpt">To avoid being attacked by the people they surprised, hot air balloon pilots carried Champagne or wine with them as a way to let onlookers know they were human and to thank them for the safe landing in their field.</p>


<p>So there you have it, Champagne is the way to settle down rowdy French farmers when you&#8217;re trespassing on their property!</p>

</p>

<p>The breakfast was very fancy, even by western standards. As we approached the tables there was a guy with a basin and a jug of warm water who&#8217;d pour it so you could wash your hands, and them dry them with a real cotton towel! The table settings wouldn&#8217;t have been at all out of place in a fancy restaurant, and as we got closer I could smell my old friend bacon, sizzling away somewhere.</p>

<p>Having not had bacon since leaving home, I would have been happy if they&#8217;d served me just a plate of bacon, but there were eggs, sausages, fruit, coffee and juice&#8230; It was like a real English breakfast and then some!</p>

<p>To make the day even better, when we got back to camp Charles had make us pancakes and bacon for brunch! Could a day be any more perfect!?!</p>

<p>After brunch we got back in the Land Rovers for an afternoon of game driving with a general meander towards the gate of the park, during which we managed to spot a log more awesome animals. We found 3 lion cubs sleeping in a crevice between some rocks, then a bit later we found a cheetah, and a bit later still two more cheetahs!</p>

</p>

<p>We also saw a lion that was standing up in long grass looking around, who then sat down and completely disappeared, making it very clear how hard it could be to spot these animals if they were trying to hide.</p>

<p>The drive out seemed like it was 10x as dusty as the drive in; even with large gaps between our vehicles and us rapidly closing our windows every time we passed another car, everything in the Land Rovers was covered in a thick coating of dust by the time we got out of the park.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014838763/" title="It was dusty by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/10014838763_7f2f1d9f38_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="It was super dusty" class="img-responsive"><br><em>It was super dusty</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We headed back up to the crater rim to Simba Camp where we were staying the night. It was freezing cold that night and although there were showers with a hot tap, the water that came out was barely room temperature and even that quickly ran out leaving only icy water for those who wanted relief from the dust.</p>

<p>It was so cold that night that I wore pretty much every layer I had plus my Goretex wind shell, and still wasn&#8217;t particularly warm. I headed to bed pretty much straight after dinner and was thankful that our thick canvas tents held heat so well.</p>

<p>Simba camp was another unfenced camp ground, but again if there were animal sounds I managed to sleep right through them. We got up before dark and packed down camp in order to get to the Ngorongoro Crater park gates for opening, with a light drizzle of rain coming down on us.</p>

<p>As we descended into the crater the temperature rose very slightly, but the weather in that crater is completely different to that only a few KM outside of it and it remained pretty grey and cold all day.</p>

</p>

<p>Not long after passing the gate someone in out truck spotted some ears in the grass. We backed up to have a better look and found a small cat called a caracal. Were told they themselves aren&#8217;t rare, but it&#8217;s quite rare to see them. Steve had never seen one in all his years in Africa, and our driver who&#8217;s in and out of the park all the time hadnt seen one in 4 years.</p>

</p>

<p>In contrast to the steep walls of the crater, the bottom of it was mostly quite flat, with lots of open plains, some forested areas and a few large watering holes.</p>

</p>

<p>We saw several elands in the forests, and hundreds of wildebeast and zebra out roaming the plains.</p>

</p>

<p>We saw a pair of birds call grey crowned cranes which our driver explained to us were married, as in they were paired for life, but if divorce statistics are to be believed that&#8217;s probably no longer a great analogy.</p>

</p>

<p>We did manage to spot one male lion sleeping in the grass, and several females sleeping in the distance, but because the weather was cold the big cats were mostly sleeping, and sadly for us were largely well away from the road.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014871603/" title="Sleepy male lion by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2852/10014871603_23a4d8c0b6_c.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Sleepy male lion" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Sleepy male lion</em>
</a></p>

<p>What we didn&#8217;t see in terms of big cats was largely made up for by the number of hyenas we saw around. We must have seen at least 4-5 separate individuals or groups, one of with was a full family with a number of cubs playing. Very cute for a part of &#8220;the ugly 5&#8221;!</p>

</p>

<p>On the drive out of the park, back to civilisation where we were camping that night, we learnt a few tidbits about the Masai culture that partly explained how it can be normal to have multiple wives without a huge gender imbalance, or a lot of men having no wives.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10000755303/" title="Masai shepard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/10000755303_b7bdcb497f_c.jpg" width="800" height="273" alt="Masai's are allowed to graze their cattle in the Serengeti" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Masai&#8217;s are allowed to graze their cattle in the Serengeti</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The number of wives a Masai man has is directly related to how many cattle he has, so having lots of cattle means lots of wives. The interesting part we learnt about was that the non-monogamy/polyamory that goes on apparently works in both directions. A man has many wives, but if he goes to visit one and finds a spear dug in the ground outside of her house, it means she has a male guest &#8220;visiting,&#8221; and that the husband should go and find a different bed to stay in that night, we&#8217;re told all with no jealousy!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that means that a woman actually has multiple husbands, but it does offer a bit of an explanation why wifeless men aren&#8217;t rioting about there being no available women because of the greedy guys with all the cattle.</p>

<p>After we arrived at camp, and those of us camping had set up our tents, we were taken on a village tour of Mto Wa Mbu village. We took a very long walk though their farms, through large fields of beans, tomatoes, tapioca, rice, bananas, and numerous other food plants. We were shown the different materials that the people used to build their houses. The cheapest materials being mud houses, the mid-cost ones being made of red bricks, and the most expensive also being the most ugly, cement houses.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014900033/" title="Mto Wa Mbu village farms by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3826/10014900033_eb654a8899_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="walking through the farms" class="img-responsive"><br><em>walking through the farms</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>We were taken to a local art gallery, where the locals can get taught to paint for a living, and shown the two main styles of art common in Tanzania. And boy were they common, the paintings here were 90% the same largely generic ones we&#8217;d seen from Zanzibar onwards. There was a token guy putting the finishing touches on a piece, but as always seems to be the case the piece was pretty much done and he was putting a border on it, so for all we know the paintings are mass produced in a factory and then that guy paints a border on when tourists come past. They&#8217;re all so same-y that I would not be surprised. It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;re not teaching them to utilize their creative differences instead of teaching them how to be human photocopiers.</p>

</p>

<p>There were one or two exceptions, painting completely unique from everything else on display. One of a one zebra really struck a chord with me, but I held off the urge to buy it because I didn&#8217;t want to be stuck dragging it around with me for weeks until I got back to somewhere with a reliable postal system.</p>

<p>One detour to the normal tour itinerary was a visit to see the local nightclub. We saw the sign and were intrigued and asked about it, and they were all too happy to have us have a look inside at them cleaning and setting things up. It felt kind of like something out of rave movie from the 90s, completely with a dance pit, and raised up DJ booth, and also a cool bar made of concrete and beer bottle ends.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014856956/" title="Inside the nightclub by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3731/10014856956_bfdc665c15_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Glowing like a 90s rave party" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Glowing like a 90s rave party</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The last point of interest on the tour was a stop at the local bar, to drink some of the locally made banana beer. It&#8217;s made with a special type of banana and sprouted millet and fermented for a few days giving it a alcohol percentage of roughly 1-2%. The flavour was actually not particularly banana-ry, but the price was dirt cheap! 1000 Tanzanian shillings for 0.5L, or roughly $0.30!</p>

</p>

<p>And that pretty much wraps up the time we spent in Tanzania. There was some fun to be had crossing the border into Kenya, but that&#8217;s material for the next post :)</p>

      <p>My arrival in Dar Es Salaam was pretty smooth and trouble free. I applied for my visa on arrival, along with probably 60% of the people on the flight. I was a bit slow filling out the forms and was probably one of the last people to hand in the paperwork, but it seemed like they used a LIFO queue (last in, first out) to process things so my name was soon called and I had to squeeze my way through the crowd of people waiting and get my passport.</p>

<p>I went to queue up in the immigration line, proud to show off my fancy new visa sticker, but a guy came up and told me to just walk on through. So I walked straight past the desk where they check your passport without showing them anything, and nobody batted an eyelid. It really feels like you could get into the country without a visa very easily if you just walked on through with a bit of confidence, although I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d have trouble leaving.</p>

<p>I waited for a few hours for Kat&#8217;s flight to arrive, after which we shared a taxi through some incredibly gridlocked traffic to the Hotel where Amanda, Luke, Leigh and Nicci were already checked in an waiting for us. I&#8217;d actually already had some advanced warning about the hotel&#8217;s &#8220;No Alcohol&#8221; policy, but didn&#8217;t remember to warn Kat to hide her duty-free booze until we arrived there, so she had to try and hide it behind a backpack as we went past the very prominent sign in the lobby. We managed to sneak in both our bottles of spirits without a hitch, and disrespectfully drank some of that booze in the hotel that night, the heathens we are.</p>

</p>

<p>Having been travelling solo for a few months by this point, it was really good to be among friends again although I have to admit that it took a few days before I really felt &#8220;right at home&#8221; again. I couldn&#8217;t really put a finger on exactly why that was; it was almost like reverse culture shock, except still submerged in yet another strange culture but with familiar friends.</p>

<p>Our hotel room was huge! Not at all what I was expecting in Tanzania. Not just 3rd world huge either, I reckon the lounge &amp; dining area along would have been bigger than most hotel rooms I&#8217;ve ever stayed in back in Asutralia, even including their bedrooms and bathroom. And easily the fanciest place I&#8217;ve stayed in on this trip too!</p>

<p>After our one night stay in Dar, we headed to the ferry terminal in a very overloaded taxi and got ourselves some boat tickets to Zanzibar. The terminal itself if bustling with people, and seemed like there were lines to get through metal detectors and put luggage through xray machines, except there was a constant stream of porters with giant bales of luggage shoving by as though we weren&#8217;t also trying to get through. &#8220;Those fucking tourists, standing around near the metal detectors in my way! Why are they even here?&#8221;</p>

<p>After what was probably twice as long as if people hadn&#8217;t constantly been pushing in, we got through onto the ferry where we were led upstairs to the first class area where we found all the other backpack-wielding foreigners and a bunch of tacky lounge furniture fulling every available space. The ferry ride was pretty uneventful, although the TV in the first class area provided some good talking points. It started off playing some sort of horrible wailing music (maybe prayers? It was awful), and then later was showing some crazy over-the-top afternoon TV drama.</p>

<p>We arrived at our hotel in Paje by taxi, about an hour from Stone Town, where the ferries arrive. Some guys were very quick to come over and welcome us, but then at the same time they appeared to not really be aware we were coming, even though Kat had been communicating with them right up to our arrival (They were supposed to do a transfer from the ferry terminal for us, but there was no-one there when we arrived and they stopped responding to message until we were already in a taxi). We needed to wait for an extra room to be made up because there weren&#8217;t enough rooms ready.</p>

</p>

<p>We ordered some dinner that night, and it took hours to be prepared. I&#8217;ll give them credit that it was probably the best meal they served us during out stay there, but the timeliness, or lack of it, was a sign of the week ahead of us.</p>

<p>We were told that breakfast would be at 8am. A few of us woke up early and went over to the eating area to read from about 7am, and were pleased to find the table already set. Sadly, that set a false expectation that we&#8217;d be eating soon! By 9:00 I was starting to get hunger pains from the light dinner and no lunch the day before. Finally at 9:30 breakfast came out. It consisted of some cold fried-eggs (with white yokes, which seemed to be common in East Africa), a few pieces of fruit (lots of paw paw), a pancake and a stale piece of break.</p>

<p>We quickly realised that for any time that our hotel gave us, we needed to add 90 minutes to it for it to be even remotely accurate.</p>

<p>Rant warning for luke, skip the next paragraph :P</p>

<p>You get warned about Africa time, and I went into this expecting things would be slow at times, But our hotel just shitted me. It wasn&#8217;t occasionally slow. Ever interaction with them was always hours slow. To date, it&#8217;s the most consistently slow service I&#8217;ve experience anywhere I&#8217;ve ever been in the world to date. I&#8217;ve been to restaurants where they forgot my order when they brought out everyone else&#8217;s, and still gotten my food faster than I did here. And that&#8217;s just the restaurant, then they seemed to turn off the power and water to the rooms at random times through out the day. At first we thought it was just the local infrastructure being flakey, and then we asked about it a few days in and they say &#8220;ok, we&#8217;ll turn it back on&#8221;. Rinse, lather, repeat. Over and over they&#8217;d turn off the water, and we&#8217;d over and over ask them to turn it back on. The idea that someone might want to&#8230; I dunno, have a shower during the day or flush a toilet at night seemed to escape the people running the place&#8217;s minds. I could forgive it if the place was exceptionally cheap, but this place was the 2nd most expensive accommodation of my trip to date (the place in Dar was more I think), but it was shittier than any hostel dorm I&#8217;ve stayed in, and I&#8217;ve stayed in some real dives. In short, avoid the Jaribu Beach Hotel at all costs. Ignore the TripAdvisor reviews, the place is shit and there were so many places nearby that seemed so much nicer. Lucky for us, the other places didn&#8217;t mind us coming and spending out money in their fine establishments, so that&#8217;s what we did. End rant.</p>

<p>Amanda, Luke, Kat and I spent the day wandering up the beach and stopped in at one of the local bars &#8220;Teddy&#8217;s&#8221; for a quick bite to eat. We noticed they had cheap long island ice tea&#8217;s and ended up staying for quite a few of them.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9853176176/" title="Teddy's Place! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/9853176176_daf246a07c_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Teddy's Place!" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Teddy&#8217;s Place!</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>Eventually we headed back to see what Leigh and Nicci were up to and decided to head down the beach the other direction and have a late lunch at the restaurant at the end of the long pier, attached to one of the fancier hotels in the area. The food came out quickly and was by all accounts delicious! This hotel ended up becoming our go-to place for food when were were hungry; it cost a little more than other places but it was consistently quick and delicious.</p>

</p>

<p>We rounded off the afternoon by heading to the zombie bar for a few more drinks, where ironically they don&#8217;t serve and had never even heard of the cocktail &#8220;zombie.&#8221;</p>

</p>

<p>A few of us were hungry again by the time we got back to our hotel, so we ordered some pancakes with banana and chocolate as a going to bed snack. Except without banana because they were out of that. Oh, and no chocolate either, because that&#8217;s obviously quite perishable and you don&#8217;t want to keep too much of it on hand. We were offered sugar in place of the missing ingredients, we were hungry so we went with it. Ninety minutes later we had pancakes, which in our drunk state were pretty damn delicious, even lacking 2/3rds of the advertised ingredients.</p>

<p>The net day Amanda, Kat and I went on a walking tour of the local village, led by a guy named Jamu that Amanda had met on the beach early the day before. Everyone else decided they were too hungover to go along and stayed back to get more sleep, which I probably should really have done too. I was definitely feeling pretty average for most of that day, but I&#8217;d decided to go and I&#8217;m stubborn like that.</p>

</p>

<p>Anyhow, the tour was quite good. We were shown how they braid the girls hair, which got demonstrated on the edge of my beard too. It was quite impressive how they make rope from the husks of a coconut, soaked in seawater for several weeks to soften it up. The finished product was really just like rope you&#8217;d buy at Bunnings! . We saw how palm tree leaves are thatched into building materials, and some very basic henna artwork.</p>

</p>

<p>Most days in that first week on Zanzibar followed a pretty similar schedule. Wake up, wait for ages for breakfast. Sit around reading and generally relaxing. Go somewhere for lunch. Relax some more. Sometime we&#8217;d go up to the fancy hotel to use their pool. It was a very chilled way to spend a week.</p>

</p>

<p>One other day of note was the day we went and had lunch at The Rock restaurant, which is as the name implies, a restaurant built on a rock! And that rock is in the ocean, so you have to get a boat there unless the tide is all the way out. It&#8217;s extremely picturesque!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9853098706/" title="The Rock Restaurant by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/9853098706_eb5f8809f3_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="The Rock Restaurant" class="img-responsive"><br><em>The Rock Restaurant</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The food there was fabulous. For an entrée I had some very tasty garlic queen prawns. For a main I shared &#8220;The Rock Special&#8221; with Kat, as the wait staff had made a big deal about how it was &#8220;for two&#8221;. It came out with lobster, a huge king prawn, some Balmain bug, and some fish. Everything was really very tasty, but I could have devoured the whole meal by myself, and having looked at the menu beforehand had gone there expecting to. In the end I was cracking lobster legs, trying to get just every last bit of meat out to try and satisfy my hunger.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a shame they made out it was enough for two people as my expectations for paying a fair bit for that meal had already been set and I would have been completely happy to order it for myself; but them pushing it as &#8220;for two&#8221; made all of us think it must have been heaps of food so everyone shared. In the end I think that they were just trying to get past the average person&#8217;s aversion to spend a lot of money on a nice meal, which is unfortunate since we went away hungry having spent a lot less than what we went there expecting to spend.</p>

</p>

<p>After lunch, we went out on a small boat with an outboard motor to a reef a few hundred meters along the coast line to do a bit of snorkelling, a totally safe activity after just eating and having had a few beers :P We managed to see a number of nice bannerfish, some black and some pink anemone fish (think nemo), some parrot fish, and what I thought was a huge pipefish 40cm long, but I&#8217;ve since discovered is called a trumpetfish.</p>

<p>After snorkelling, we came back to land and met a friendly Masai who called himself Mr Discount! He even claimed to have change! A rarity in Africa! If any of us had wanted a bracelet or other trinket, this is the guy we&#8217;d have bought it from.</p>

</p>

<p>After our very lazy week in Paje, we headed back to Stone Town to meet up with the Dragoman tour group that would be our family for the next 5 weeks. We very briefly met out English group leader Steve, before heading out to do a quick walking tour of Stone Town with our local guide for Zanzibar, Daniel.</p>

<p>We had some free time to explore the town that afternoon before meeting up with the group again that evening at the Africa Club Hotel for some drinks while we watched the sunset, where we got to have a better chat with Steve who bore a striking resemblance to our English mate Matty Poppins and found that he seemed to share a similar set of mannerisms and cheeky smile too. We also started getting to know a few of the other people on the tour, including Pete and Deb, a lovely pair of Australian&#8217;s roughly my parents age who were both very much young at heart, and very easy to get along with.</p>

<p>Over the course of the trip I think these two became my favourite people on the tour, with Pete being a bit of a joker and making some insightful but almost Karl Pilkington like observations (and I say that in the kindest way, Karl is awesome) and Deb almost becoming like a bit of a mother to the group.</p>

</p>

<p>After the Sun had set, everyone headed to the night seafood market for dinner. There were loads of stalls set up, trying to get your business, each with a table full of fresh seafood that you could pick and choose that they&#8217;d fry up for you to eat. I had a number of skewers with different kinds of fish and tandoori lobster and some octopus and felt very full but satisfied afterwards.</p>

<p>After dinner we moved on to a bar called Mercury Bar, named so because Freddy Mercury was apparently born on Zanzibar. I don&#8217;t think anyone actually know for certain where he lived, but it doesn&#8217;t stop them naming all kinds of things on Zanzibar &#8220;Mercury this&#8221; and &#8220;Mercury that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day we did a bit of a local tour, we saw the site of the old slave markets (which the Christians craftily built a church at, so you can&#8217;t visit without hearing a bunch of additional religious stuff as well), visited a real local fish and meat market, and went on a tour of a spice plantation where we got to smell and taste all sort of fresh spices. The biggest surprise for me was cinnamon roots, which smelt like tiger balm, while the bark and wood of the tree smelt&#8230; like cinnamon, how you&#8217;d expect it to smell.</p>

</p>

<p>We stopped in for lunch at Daniel&#8217;s house for lunch, where one of his neighbours had cooked up a very tasty curry, with some nice mango as a desert. As seems to be the case with all construction in Africa, Daniel&#8217;s house was still a work in progress with some of the rooms being finished off while other were still being worked on when he had the time and money to do some more work.</p>

<p>We stayed the night at the north end of the island at a place called Nungwi beach, a much more sheltered bit of beach than where we&#8217;d been in Paje, and definitely a lot more frequented by tourist. It definitely felt a lot less 3rd world than we&#8217;d grown accustomed to, a very nice change before we switched over to sleeping in tents every night on the mainland!</p>

<p>We had a meeting that evening where were were given the low-down on trip kitty and such, and it became apparent that it wasn&#8217;t going to be a simple matter of going to an ATM and withdrawing the required amount.</p>

<p>Money in Tanzania is a royal pain in the ass. Their largest note is 10,000 shillings, which sounds like heaps, but is actually less than USD $7. This means that getting out a few hundred dollars is a giant thick wad of cash. And nobody in Tanzania ever seems to have change, even though they&#8217;re in the business of trying to sell you stuff. Apparently it&#8217;s you the customer&#8217;s job to have the right money, or just buy more stuff!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9853184525/" title="1.4M Tanzanian Shillings, next to 100T Zimbabwe Dollars by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/9853184525_8312cc1ef4_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="1.4M Tanzanian Shillings, next to 100T Zimbabwe Dollars" class="img-responsive"><br><em>1.4M Tanzanian Shillings, next to 100T Zimbabwe Dollars</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>Upon joining the trip we were told that the trip kitty is strongly preferred in USD, because although all these countries we are visiting have their own currency, they all charge park fees in the currency from a country on the other side of the planets, which of course is not readily available from ATMs. ATMs dispense local currency, in thick wads that only amount to about USD$200. The ATMs have a very low per-transaction limit (which I think is actually a physical limit, more money would not fit in the money dispensing slot), but then have a fairly low total per day limit too (about $600). Combined this with the large time difference between Africa and Australia, and our Australian banks daily withdrawal limits that reset based on Australian time-zones&#8230; let&#8217;s just say it made getting the large sums of money needed for the kitty quite challenging. In the end it took probably 15-20 separate ATM withdrawals to get the money required(ignoring the attempts where the ATMs were just plain out of money, because an ATM can only hold so much paper, and when your biggest note is worth $7 an ATM really doesn&#8217;t hold very much), and then a few visits to banks to actually get the USD (Leigh and Nicci managed to clean our a few money changing places of all their USD). I found it doubley annoying because I&#8217;d only just been in Zimbabwe a few weeks earlier, where the ATMs dispense USD and I could have stocked up there, but the trip notes had misled us into thinking local currency would be acceptable and it seemed a lot safer than carrying thousands of dollars in cash around South Africa.</p>

</p>

<p>On the plus side though, how often do you get the chance to literally roll around on a bed covered in millions of shillings in hundred of bills?</p>

<p>The next day was a day of free time, so I got myself signed up to go out and do two dives with a shop called Spanish Dancer divers. It&#8217;s a sort of funny name, but a spanish dancer is actually a kind of swimming nudibranch that looks a bit like the dress of a flamenco dancer when they swim.</p>

<p>We took a speedboat out to the reef near Mnemba Island, and when we were nearly there we were lucky enough to have a pod of dolphins come swiming past us, so we jumped in with just fins and mask and got a bonus swim with the dolphins that day. They didn&#8217;t hang around for long, but the whole pod did shoot past right underneath me which was very cool.</p>

<p>The dives themselves were fantastic! I saw some cool looking long-nose butterfly fish and some smaller blue bat-fish (which I looked up and are actually called a red lips triggerfish, which I think is a stupid name because I didn&#8217;t even notice the red lips, but I sure did notice they were blue and swam like bats :P). I saw quite a large octopus strobe colours a bit at me, and then slunk away and hide under a rock, and we also found a turtle just chilling out on the reef, not phased by us in the slightest.</p>

<p>After our time on Zanzibar was over, the tour group got the ferry back over to Dar, and then another local ferry to where our overland truck was waiting for us and we got our first look at the place we&#8217;d come to know as &#8220;home&#8221; over the next 5 weeks. It was a huge orange thing, sort of like what you&#8217;d get if a semi-trailer and a coach loved each other very much and made a baby. Except we weren&#8217;t allowed to call it a bus, cause it doesn&#8217;t like that and breaks down if you do.</p>

<p>Drivers in Tanzania are bad. Really bad. Steve told us they were the worst in African, and I agree whole heartedly. I&#8217;d probably say they&#8217;re up there near the top of the board for worst drivers world-wide, and that&#8217;s coming from someone who&#8217;d recently been through both Vietnam and India. After spending our first night in tents in Dar, we were up and ready to leave 5am to try and beat the traffic, and I would have hated to have seen it any later. It was near gridlock at 5-fucking-am. Traffic was backed up for ages at one point because someone had decided to park their bus in one of the lanes exiting a two lane roundabout. I saw quite a number of cars just driving right over the middle of the roundabout in order to push in front by 2-3 vehicles. And not this sissy roundabouts that you&#8217;re supposed to drive over, this was the real deal with proper kerbs.</p>

<p>Ok, so none of that sounds all that bad, right? Well, within a period of about 5 minutes we actually had two very near misses because of fucktards driving buses trying to overtake us with imminent oncoming traffic. This wasn&#8217;t like in India where everyone overtakes all the time but it works out because everyone chilled and there&#8217;s always room to slow and let people in, and there&#8217;s secretly three lanes where they&#8217;ve only marked two. Traffic was moving way too slowly for us to slow down to make a gap for the bus, so they solved their pending head-on collision by just pulling back into our lane while alongside us, quite literally running us off the road. If our driver David hadn&#8217;t swerved off the road there definitely would have been a collision, which probably would have meant 3-vehicle pile up with the oncoming traffic. It&#8217;s a good thing there was a level dirt shoulder next to the road and not a drainage ditch, otherwise we would have rolled over and I might have been writing this from a hospital bed, or maybe even not at all.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only so many times you can get overtaken by a bus with a broken axle, that cant even drive straight proper, that feels like it must be doing +130-140% of your speed before you draw the conclusion it&#8217;s not just a few deadshits, everyone in the country is seriously out to kill you.</p>

<p>One way they (and most other East African countries) try and deal with this is by liberally littering the roads with speed humps. Not just in low speed areas like we use them back home, carparks and the like, but on the highways. With no warning signs. And they&#8217;re pretty much never painted so they stand out. They basically work like &#8220;SURPRISE! HERE, LET ME FUCK UP YOUR SUSPENSION FOR YOU!&#8221;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t count the number of times the truck braked extremely hard to try soften the impact of these surprise speed humps. I actually find it mind-boggling that the sudden braking caused by the lack of signs doesn&#8217;t itself cause accidents.</p>

<p>Anyway, after escaping the nightmare traffic, we found a gas station in the middle of nowhere where we could stop and have the first of many roadside meals. The process of everyone getting out the tables, cooking gear and stools, prepping food and is quite a sight to see, and got to be really quite efficient as we got in the swing of things. For side-of-the-road breakfast, it was pretty fancy. We had cooked eggs, cereal, baked beans and toast. A good sign of things to come from our jovial truck cook, Charles.</p>

</p>

<p>Bureaucracy anywhere is generally a nuisance set up to make someone feel important, and Tanzania has it&#8217;s fair share of it. At one point during out travels we were waved through a weigh station by a policeman, then chased down the road 10KM by a weigh station official who wanted to know why we didn&#8217;t go through. He didn&#8217;t care that the cop waved us through and made to turn around on a very narrow road to go back and get weighed.</p>

<p>You can imagine how impressed Steve was when handed a sheet of old style printer paper, blank aside from a hand written number on it that was apparently our vehicle weight. Apparently they&#8217;d run out of ink, but it was vitally important that we have a impossible to forge handwritten note to show the next weigh station. Apparently.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s pretty much everything of interest we did in Tanzania. I think we also went to some park called the Serengeti too, which was just a bunch of yellow grass. Boring stuff, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re not interested in hearing about that :P</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>So while in South Africa I managed to see the two main places people go, Johannesburg and Cape Town, which are pretty much at opposite ends of any spectrum you can imagine. Safety, things to do, how pretty the city is&#8230; Johannesburg ranks very low and Cape Town generally ranks pretty well.</p>

<p>My time in Johannesburg was pretty whirlwind-ish. I&#8217;d already decided that I didn&#8217;t really want to spend much time there and would rather get to Cape Town, but I wanted to see the Apartheid Museum and I needed to reconfirm that I was actually eligible for my Tanzanian Visa on arrival, otherwise I&#8217;d need to make the 100KM trip to Pretoria to visit their consulate.</p>

<p>The visa thing ended up being a pretty simple phone call. They urged me to apply before hand, I explained that I wasn&#8217;t in Pretoria, they confirmed that I could get it on arrival. Booyah!</p>

<p>I asked quite a few locals about safety in Johannesburg and if the whole danger thing was as big of an issue as people make out and was told I&#8217;d be fine as long as I stuck to safe areas. So none of the aimless exploring that makes travelling fun; just stick to the touristy spots and you&#8217;ll be fine&#8230; and feel like a tourist.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9760054951/" title="Who the fuck attacks a blind busker?

</p>

<p>I decided the most cost effective way to get to the Apartheid Museum was to get on the city site-seeing bus which stopped there, and would also let me see a few other sites. The tour gave some interesting trivia, but felt like they were really stretching for content in a lot of places where they&#8217;d point out pretty but unimportant building X, and boarded up building Y.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9760170266/" title="Derelict building in Johannesburg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7307/9760170266_f676b216a9_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="There were derelict buildings like this all over Johannesburg" class="img-responsive"><br><em>There were derelict buildings like this all over Johannesburg</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The Apartheid Museum was great, and I got very lucky with my timing as they had a special exhibit about Nelson Mandela on too. For those as ignorant as I was, the South African Apartheid was a system of segregation enforced by the government, dividing up the whites, the blacks and the coloured people, not allowing the groups to mix or mingle and giving a load of preferential treatment to the whites while treating the black people like shit. Oh, and this was happening right up into the early 90s; It&#8217;s shocking to think that if I&#8217;d been born a South African I actually would have lived 1/3rd of my life under such a system. It made me wonder a lot about the white South Africans I was coming into contact with and wondering how they&#8217;d felt about the whole thing while it was privileging them. And about the black South Africans I met, and how I couldn&#8217;t fault them for being extremely bitter about the whole thing, still so fresh but being told to get over it.</p>

</p>

<p>On my other day in Joburg I undertook the cultural experience of catching one of the local minibus&#8217; to East Gate shops in search of needed camp gear for my upcoming overland tour.</p>

<p>These are basically your standard white minivan that you flag down and they&#8217;ll give you a lift where they&#8217;re going for less than $1. I was the only white guy on the minibus in both directions and it felt like having a white guy in there was a bit of a novelty. Someone from the bus actually came up and said hello to me in the shopping centre later, only adding to the feeling that white people don&#8217;t really catch the minibus&#8217; often.</p>

<p>I met a friendly American named Erin at my Johannesburg hostel, who was heading to Cape Town a day earlier than me. She sent me a message after she arrived saying how great Cape Town was and how I should definitely spend my time there instead of Joburg. So I booked my flight for early the next morning and that was that!</p>

<p>When I arrived at my Cape Town hostel and walked in the door, I was nearly right away greeted by Phoebe and Victoria from my previous tour up to Victoria Falls. What a lovely coincidence!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9760628495/" title="Table Mountain by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3739/9760628495_7ab23d32be_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Table Mountain, not the day we climbed it though.

</p>

<p>They were just about to head up Table Mountain, so I quickly chucked my stuff in a locker and joined them to share the taxi. It was an absolutely perfect day for it, clear skys and sunny; pretty much still air. The wind up there often gets in excess of 100 Km/h and they close it down, so to have such a nice still day in the middle of winter was fantastic. The terrain was visually very interesting, and we saw some strange little animals called a rock hyrax, a strange and unexpected relative to elephants.</p>

</p>

<p>That evening they had a braai at the hostel, the South African take on BBQs, which was crazy delicious. I dunno what they do to their potatos but they&#8217;re addictive, and those long boerewors sausages are great. Erin dropped around from her hostel around the corner and we hung out drinking beers for a while before I had to retire reasonably early for my shark cage diving the next morning.</p>

<p>I got picked up at 5am and hopped into a minibus which I promptly fell asleep on and woke up a few hours later when we were arriving. They gave us a full english breakfast before fitting us with life jackets and getting us onto the boat and heading out to the site. The water around Cape Town in the middle of winter is hovering around 9-10ºC, so well-worn 7mm wetsuits were given out to us, which annoyingly meant that moving your arms too much would flush in new cold water into the suit.</p>

<p>They attract the sharks to swim by the cage by chumming the water with rotting fish guts and fish oil, and then lure them closer still with a fish head on a rope that they chuck in the water buy yank out of the sharks reach as it approaches. There&#8217;s actually <a href="http://www.stopsharkcagediving.com/">a movement against this kind of shark cage diving</a>, which claims there are alternate methods of attracting them using &#8220;audio sound vibration&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know if the science checks out, but I do admit it felt &#8220;not quite right&#8221; attracting the sharks by teasing them, but it was still an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>Diving is probably the wrong word for how this actually works. They have a cage hanging off the side of the boat in which 8 people hop in, and then drop down in the cage and breath-hold to see the sharks. I was in the first group in the water and we were pretty stoked to see quite a number of 2.5-3 metre Great Whites pass by and under the cage at close range. After about 45 minutes in the freezing water, we hopped out and let 8 more people jump in for a turn.</p>

<p>There were some volunteers up on the top deck of the boat who were trying to identify the sharks to track how many unique sharks there were, and how they behaved (ie. if they were just passing by, attacking the bait, returned attempts etc). From their count, we saw 9 different Great whites that day.</p>

<p>After all the customers had a turn in the cage they let staff &amp; volunteers have a turn, and there were two extra spots so I jumped back in for another round. It turned out to be a fantastic decision on my part, as I while I was in the cage the second time a shark charged at the bait directly towards the cage and was too slow to turn after the bait was yoinked and it rammed right into the cage. Directly in front of me. It was fucking nuts, and the level of excitement in the cage was through the roof! Probably just as well it was mostly volunteers as I think some of the other people on the boat might have freaked the fuck out.</p>

<em>I didn&#8217;t take my camera, but this is pretty much exactly what I saw</em></p>


<p>Aside from the antics I witnessed from inside the cage, I was also privileged enough to see not one, but two sharks attacking seals on the surface (not sure if they got away, we didn&#8217;t see much after the initial splash) and we had a whale come up 15 Metres from the boat (with a whale watching boat following it :P).</p>

<p>On the way back to shore we went through a channel called &#8220;Shark Alley&#8221;. We didn&#8217;t see any sharks, but the rocks along the side were covered in literally 1000&#8217;s of seals! Everywhere you looked there was blubber flapping around. I can imagine it&#8217;s like a buffet for the sharks!</p>

<p>That evening I met up with Erin again for gelati, an odd choice for the middle of winter but it was her last night in Cape Town and it was a delicious choice.</p>

</p>

<p>The next day I looked at a map and decided to walk to a strip of beach I heard was nice called Camps Bay. I walked for what must have been 2-3 hours along the coast line, and while it was a nice walk I was getting tired so I gave in and got a minibus for what turned out to be the second, much hillier half of the walk. Sort of wish I&#8217;d just gotten the minibus the whole way, but it really did look like a short walk on the map. When I got there I practiced juggling and poi in the shade for a while, and then headed back by minibus to Cape Town.</p>

</p>

<p>I also went on a tour of Langa township, one of the townships that they forced the non-whites to live in during the apartheid years. To be honest I didn&#8217;t really feel comfortable there; the whole thing was a bit voyeuristic and I really didn&#8217;t feel comfortable going into peoples homes to have a look, even when they insisted. It just felt completely different to the villages we visited in India, or even the slums; I just got the feeling that if I was one of these people I wouldn&#8217;t want people coming to look at how shitty my living circumstances were. It was pretty heart breaking to see the poverty that these people are still living in; we saw one room of a &#8220;hostel&#8221; that was probably 3M x 3M, that was the home of three separate families.</p>

</p>

<p>That afternoon I made it out to Robben island, where they kept Nelson Mandela and a lot of other political prisoners. The most interesting part out there was a talk given to us by an actual political prisoner. It was interesting to hear that amongst the prisoners they referred to the prison as &#8220;the university&#8221;, since it was full of all the people the government didn&#8217;t really want talking to one another, but the prisoners had sneaky ways of doing so anyway.</p>

</p>

<p>I met a pleasant Italian lady named Paola who was also travelling alone, and we decided to get the City Site-Seeing bus together to see some of the more distance sites of cape town. We made stops in at the botanical gardens for a walk about, at a winery for a tour and tasting, and at a bay called Houts bay, a surreal bay that feels like there&#8217;s mountains surrounding you on all sides where we saw some seals frolicking in shallow water.</p>

</p>

<p>That evening we meet some friendly Germans who&#8217;d just arrived at our hostel, Anne and Sophie, who we have a few drinks at the hotel bar and convince to come on the other line of the site-seeing bus with us the next day.</p>

<p>We stopped off for a bit of a walk through the CBD and were a bit surprised by just how quite it was, hopped back on and drove through District 6 (The mixed-race surburb that was completely demolished, but then never rebuilt because of the backlash from the international community), then stopped at table mountain which was this time sadly blanketed in clouds. Sophie and Anne were keen to go up and hope for the best, Paola wasn&#8217;t so keen, and I&#8217;d already been up, so Paola and I continued on around the loop, which turned out didn&#8217;t actually have many more noteworthy stops before getting back to the waterfront considering the distance it covered.</p>

</p>

<p>We had lunch at a nice brewery pub called Mitchell&#8217;s Brewery, with a great range of their own beers. I got a sampler &#8220;paddle&#8221; of there beers and they had a few really great ones; I wish I&#8217;d found the place sooner, instead of on my last day there.</p>

</p>

<p>After lunch I sorted my bags into a flight ready state and headed to the airport to fly to Johannesburg Airport, where I spent the night which saved me a little money and meant I didn&#8217;t need to stress about getting there crazy early in the morning for my international flight to Dar Es Salaam the next morning. I set up camp near a group of English backpackers (safety in numbers ;)); I blew up my air mattress and rolled out my sleeping bag and tried to sleep, but being an airport meant incredibly bright lighting all night (which eye-shades dealt with fine) and loud music and regular &#8220;don&#8217;t leave you bag unattended announcements&#8221; (which ear plugs failed to help much with) so I didn&#8217;t actually sleep all that much.</p>

</p>

<p>I noticed that one of the other English backpackers just plain refused to even try to sleep, and spent pretty much the whole night on his feet, drinking beers (that he couldn&#8217;t take through cause of liquid restrictions) and quietly reading a book. What a lout! :P</p>

<p>The next morning, or rather later that night when I gave up trying to sleep, I was able to check in quite early (like 5 hours before the flight) and get through to the air-side of the airport and do my obligatory duty free booze buying and wait for my flight to Tanzania for my next adventure.</p>

      <p>I changed my flight to South Africa to be a day sooner in order to get to Johannesburg in time on Monday morning to go on a week long tour up to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and back. Booking in on this tour was a bit of a spur of the moment thing, I&#8217;d only found out about it&#8217;s existence the Wednesday beforehand; I checked if I could change my flights and if there was room on the bus, then got flights moved and got myself booked in.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9661702941/" title="Stunning Sunrise in Botswana by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="Stunning Sunrise in Botswana" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/9661702941_1fe06b4986_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Stunning Sunrise in Botswana</em>
</a></p>

<p>I was picked up from the &#8220;hostel&#8221; I was staying in (It was really just a guys house that he let people stay in&#8230; you cant call it a hostel and only have one bathroom &amp; toilet) at 5am. I had been told the day before where the keys were to open the front door, the front verandah cage and the massive padlock on the front gate, topped with an electric fence, and had been told to go out and unlock all the locks, then come inside and wait looking out the window for the bus to show up. At the time I&#8217;d though it must have been a terrible neighbourhood to merit all that security, but having spent more time in South Africa I&#8217;ve found that pretty much everywhere has crazy levels of security like that so I&#8217;m not so sure anymore.</p>

<p>The bus arrived on time and I was the first person to be picked up. Our guide David, an friendly guy with a goofy laugh and a missing front tooth, introduced himself and we headed off to pick up more people, two Australian sisters from Sydney, then two English guys, then two Swiss sisters and two American cousins. Quite a few pairs of relatives!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We drove for a while before stopping for breakfast at a large service station, where we met up with another mini-bus full of people also on the tour. I picked up some suspect biltong to snack on during the trip here, which may have been a huge mistake.</p>

<p>We drove another few hours before stopping for lunch, still in South Africa just before the Botswanan border. Just after lunch, while talking with some of the people from the other bus, I suddenly felt a bit dizzy and had to sit down. As the day went on I started to feel really bloated and got some really nasty stomach cramps; it felt like the symptoms of diarrhea except every time I went to the toilet I couldn&#8217;t do any more than a fart.</p>

<p>The day dragged on and I felt worse and worse until we finally arrived at the camp ground at Elephant Sands at nearly 22:00&#8230; 17 hours on the road. I couldnt eat more than a bread roll at dinner and wasn&#8217;t in the mood to fuck around putting up tents in the dark, so I &#8220;upgraded&#8221; to stay in a room that night. It cost way to much for a very basic room with no glass in the windows, only fly screens; but I would have paid any amount at the time because I was feeling so awful.</p>

<p>In the morning the room&#8217;s attached toilet became a wonderful investment as yesterdays bloated constipation turned into a number 7 on the bristol stool scale. The bloating and some of the cramps went away which was a welcome relief. I went to grab my bags and head over to the other people from the tour having breakfast when I suddenly needed to dash back to the toilet. Eventually I made it over to the bus, but had to make yet another trip to the bathroom before we left.</p>

<p>People say nothing compares to the thrill of bungee jumping, sky-diving and a host of other adrenaline based sports, but I don&#8217;t think any of them could really compare to the thrill of having full blown diarrhea on a long road trip. The edge of your seat excitement, wondering if you&#8217;ll make it to the next rest stop before your belly decides it&#8217;s held things in long enough&#8230; It&#8217;s a thrill that I wouldn&#8217;t wish on anyone.</p>

<p>Thankfully I made it through the 8-9 hours of driving without any accidents with pure good luck, I swallowed a shit load of Imodium but it did nothing to the consistency of the filth spraying out of my behind at each rest stop we stopped at.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9665072956/" title="Heading to Zimbabwe by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="Heading to Zimbabwe" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/9665072956_83d0b0461e_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Heading to Zimbabwe</em>
</a></p>

<p>We set up our tents in the Victoria Falls Rest Camp and then headed to the actual falls themselves for a self-guided tour. When we arrived there was a stall trying to convince us to rent rain coats but none of us did. The sound of the falls is amazing, hearing tonnes of water per second smashing down onto rocks a hundred metres below makes a thunderous roar like you can only imagine.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9665101018/" title="Victoria Falls by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="Victoria Falls" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/9665101018_75be0a5106_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Victoria Falls</em>
</a></p>

<p>For the most part, we were fairly dry with only a bit of spray from the falls in places, but then towards the far end of the walking path the amount of water in the air shot up dramatically, cutting what we could see to very little and completely soaking us in the process. It&#8217;s a good thing that winter days in zimbabwe are actually pretty warm and pleasant!</p>

<p>We watched someone bungee jump off the bridge over the falls, the same bridge where a bungee cord snapped a little while back while an Australian lady was jumping. She survived and now the bungee jump is run by a South African company and supposedly a whole lot safer now. I had been pretty keen on doing a bridge swing, but with my stomach how it was I decided that was completely off the table now.</p>

<p>We went back to camp, with a stop in at the activities company to book in activities for the days we were there, and waited while dinner was being cooked&#8230; and waited&#8230; and waited. Apparently somebody had come and bought all the firewood, so the guides had had to buy some green wood and it wasn&#8217;t burning well so dinner wasn&#8217;t ready until after 10pm that night. Still feeling pretty awful, I went to bed before dinner was ready and only managed to eat because I got up to go the bathroom and saw it was ready.</p>

<p>The next day I went and found a chemist, armed with my little book of how to deal with various travel illnesses, and got myself some antibiotics to kill whatever was in my gut. I took a double dose as recommended by the booklet and within just a few hours stared to feel a whole lot better. The cramps disappeared entirely and my belly stopped feeling constantly bloated. Lucky for me too, as I&#8217;d booked in for a helicopter flight that morning!</p>

<p>It was the first time I&#8217;d ever been in a helicopter and I&#8217;d opted for the longer flight option that circled around over the Zambezi river as well as the falls. This turned out to be a good idea because it meant that there was only me and another girl from the tour, plus the pilot, in the helicopter, which mean that he only had to worry about putting on a good show for the one side of the helicopter. When we saw hippos, giraffes, and other wild animals, the pilot would circle around so we got a good view.</p>

<p>The view of the falls from the air was spectacular. It was incredible to see all the previous sites of the falls, a deep canyon that zig-zagged across the land, all now covered in thick vegetation with the river flowing deep below.</p>

</a></p>

<p>When we got back I noticed the next helicopter ride, one of the shorter flights, was packed to capacity&#8230; It looked like quite a squeeze with some very large gentlemen climbing on board.</p>

<p>All over Victoria Falls town, there are guys trying to sell you the old Zimbabwe money, a product of the hyper-inflation that led to money that was worth more as kindling than it was as money. I got myself a 50 billion dollar note and was pretty chuffed, until I found that hyper-inflation had gone way past 50 billion and the largest bill was 100 trillion. I did manage to secure myself a 100 trillion dollar bill, and also a 1 dollar bill, both with an issue date only 1 year apart!</p>

</a></p>

<p>That afternoon I was booked in to go and ride an elephant, visit rhinos and go on a night game drive followed by a delicious African dinner, with the company of my Australian friends Phoebe and Victoria. On the elephant ride we saw a lot of impalas right at the start, but then disappointingly little aside from birds after that.</p>

</a></p>

<p>The rhinos were amazing, there would have probably been 10 or so gathered around the food thingy in their sanctuary (they&#8217;re free to roam, but appear to be pretty reliant on the people looking after them and feeding them) and the cutest little baby rhino with them. The funny little squeaky sounds they make are not the sounds you&#8217;d expect from something as large as a rhino, and their little faces really look just like dinosaurs. We got to see a few confrontations between them too when one rhino would try and push its way into the food trough, and they would face each other off and charge towards one another.</p>

</a></p>

<p>The &#8220;night&#8221; game drive was spectacular until the sun went down. We had some spectacular scenes of elephants and giraffes with the African sun setting behind them in the first part of it, but after the sun went down it got cold very quickly, and we found practically no more animals once it was dark, even with the bright red spotlight the driver was scanning around with.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Dinner was a buffet with some really night African style curry and vegetables, just the sort of nutrition I was in need of after several days where I could hardly eat. I was really glad that Phoebe and Victoria were there for dinner, or it would be just been me and a family eating together. The drive back from dinner was done in one of the open safari trucks and oh boy was it cold. The cold air blowing against my head felt like it was giving me an ice cream headache.</p>

<p>The next day I crossed over into Zambia with the two English guys from the tour, Bernard and Steven. We walked to the border, and crossed over by foot (sadly no special stamp for walking border crossings), then got a taxi on the other side to Livingstone town, about 10km away. We didn&#8217;t really have much of an idea what we wanted to do in Zambia so we had the taxi driver take us on a bit of a tour around the town, pointing out old buildings, hot night clubs and bustling markets.</p>

<p>He stopped at a strip of tourist markets, where the shopkeep at every store wanted to stop you, shake you hand and say hello, and friendly-force you into there stalls for a look, &#8220;Looking is free!&#8221;. After the 10th time I had had enough and sat down with the old ladies actually crafting things. The whole routine feels hospitable on the surface, but is thickly layered in desperation and annoyance and makes me not want to even look if I&#8217;m forced to look at everything. Even back home I avoid shops, I prefer to buy shit online and not have to deal with clueless sales staff, so being made to look inside a hundred stalls selling the African equivalent of tiny stuffed koalas and kangaroos is pretty much my version of hell.</p>

<p>That said, I did look in one shop that had some very unique paintings and I even bought one. They had cutesy African animals juxtaposed with unlikely tools and equipment. For example two giraffes sharing iPod headphones, a lion doing weights holding a barbell over its head, a parachuting hippopotamus and a leopard being shot out of a cannon; just like you see in the wild. I wish I&#8217;d taken photos, but I&#8217;ve just realised I didn&#8217;t even photograph the one I bought so now I have to hope it makes it home in the post safely.</p>

<p>After a stop in for some lunch we got a taxi back to the border, and Steven and Bernard crossed over as they were going swimming with crocodiles that afternoon. I stayed in Zambia and went to view the falls from that side. The view from Zambia was completely amazeballs. It just seemed like you could see more and get closer, without the mist in the air becoming opaque and blocking the view. Not that there wasn&#8217;t a lot of water in the air, the Zambian side made the other side look positively dry. I started to worry that even with my camera in a white water rafting/diving dry bag it was going to get wet.</p>

</a></p>

<p>After getting thoroughly soaked I went for a walk down a different path in the national park that led to some fantastic views of the viewing bridge in front of the falls, and the boiling pot below where the Zambian white water rafting starts from.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I wish I&#8217;d had more time to take the walk down there to see the rapids up close but I got distracted by a tribe of baboons who came walking past that I followed and took a lot of photos of. At first I was a bit concerned being up so close, but they really didn&#8217;t seem to even notice I was there so I followed them for about an hour taking photos. At one stage I used the flash and them a mother baboon started walking directly towards me and I got worried and walked backwards, but she just kept coming after me and many others following. I think they had coincidentally just decided to move further down the path right after my flash went off because they ended up going around me and continuing on down the path.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I crossed back into Zimbabwe and headed back to camp for a shower, only to find that the water was not running for the 3rd day running. It seems that running water and electricity really are luxuries even in the tourist parts of Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>We went as a group that night for dinner at a place called Mama Africa and I ate a traditional Zimbabwe hot pot that was supposedly spicy beef but I couldn&#8217;t detect even a hint of spice, nor could someone else who ordered it. That&#8217;s not to say it was bad, but it definitely wasn&#8217;t the spicy meal the menu described it as.</p>

<p>The next morning we set off back to just across the Botswanan border to Chobe, a nice short drive compared to some of the previous ones. There we went on a game drive around the Chobe game lodge, a huge wildlife park teaming with wildlife. We drove along the river and saw loads of elephants and hippos heading to and from the water for a drink, and even a crocodile or two sunning themselves on the bank. Impalas frolicked, dashing about at a frantic pace leaping over ditches. Sadly the time of day meant we were driving towards the sun for almost the entire drive, and then away from a beautiful sunset; and also that all the cats were off sleeping, but it was still a great display of wildlife.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Botswana had running water and taking a shower after so many days was life changing.</p>

<p>The following day we did another very long drive, broken up by having to stop a few times to sanitize our shoes for foot and mouth disease at a few control points. This consisted of taking out shoes and wetting the soles of them with some sort of liquid that I was told was soda ash. This seems highly ineffective, considering we were also bringing tents with us covered in dirt and dust that did not need sanitizing.</p>

<p>We arrived at the camp ground for the night pretty late in the afternoon and we greeted by a man who looked a lot like an African version of Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean. We had another buffet dinner, followed by drinking games, followed by the local entertainment of twp of the staff getting into a fight and one of the guys taking his pants off. I&#8217;ve seen sometimes where guys fight they&#8217;ll take their shirt off, but stripping down to a shirt and underwear to fight is new to me.</p>

<p>The last day of the tour we had to get up stupidly early to get to the South African border before the churchies arrive and congest things. Apparently a lot of people in Botswana cross over into South Africa on a Sunday for church. The border crossing was trouble free, although we had to go and get something signed off after showing that we had our yellow fever shots because a few of us had been to Zambia, which slowed things down.</p>

<p>We had a nice breakfast at a town in South Africa before doing a group photo and saying out goodbyes, after which the two buses went different routes and the larger group was split. Another few hours of driving and we were back in Johannesburg and dropped off at the various hostels.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>So I set out on this trip aiming to travel light, with just a 46 Litre backpack and a daypack, but after nearly 4 months on the road I put up the white flag.</p>

<p>Up until I hit Africa I managed ok, but almost always had an overflow bag clipped on to make packing a bit less of a pain day to day, but I could squeeze everything in when I needed to fly.</p>

<p>Doing Africa overland demanded that I buy a sleeping bag, and air mattress, which meant I could no longer squeeze just into the two bags. I tried strapping a now quite heavy overflow bag on the back of my pack, but it just mean that weight distribution was terrible and I wasn&#8217;t carrying any less shit.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&#8217;d planned on chucking out the sleeping bag and roll-mat after Africa, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it knowing that day to day packing would still be a pain in the ass without the overflow bag, and they will probably come in handy couch surfing, and so I decided it was time to buy a bigger bag.</p>

<p>I went on an epic search in Istanbul and found countless shitty quality hiking bags (top-loaders), and nearly gave up, before finding a Deuter distributer who had a 70+10L travel pack which can hold all my stuff without expanding it.</p>

<p>The price I ended up paying is actually cheaper than it&#8217;s listed on Amazon, which I was pretty happy with. I left my old bags with the hostel we were staying with, so hopefully the go on to help someone else out.</p>

<p>What am I taking away from this? Travelling light is a great goal, but holidaying, and actually living out of a bag long term are two different things. If I was only going for a shorter, fixed period of time, with a predetermined list of destinations, I could probably be without a laptop, poi, juggling balls and a lot more easily fit into the smaller bag; but living on the road these aren&#8217;t parts of my life I&#8217;m willing to give up for what could be quite a while.</p>

      <p>On my first morning alone in Udaipur I went for a bit of an aimless wander around, and ended up at the zoo, which with my typical travel luck, was closed that day. I had a bit of a walk around the gardens surrounding it which were very nice, and sat in the shade reading a book for a few hours.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9582177058/" title="IMG_0440 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="Just my luck" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7290/9582177058_7b1513ea4a_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Just my luck</em>
</a></p>

<p>I took a very round about walk back into town and stumbled across quite a long street market which was full of colour and activity, so I spent quite a while taking photos.</p>

<p>I organised a taxi up to see the monsoon palace for sunset, right up on top of the hill overlooking Udaipur. The views of the city were fantastic, but the gloomy overcast afternoon made the sunset into a non-event.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9579543153/" title="P1110916 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="The monsoon palace" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/9579543153_aec2f9b69d_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>The monsoon palace</em>
</a></p>

<p>The next day I went back to see the zoo on a day that it is open, and instantly regretted coming. The few animals they had were in painfully small cages, which wreaked of shit; atrocious conditions that made me feel very sorry for the animals.</p>

<p>That afternoon/evening I got my flight to Mumbai on Air India. I&#8217;ve already ranted about how horribly over-the-top bureaucratic the whole thing was <a href="http://www.lucasthenomad.com/post/54015210788/airport-security-in-india">here</a>, but one thing of note that I didn&#8217;t look into until after I landed safety was Air India&#8217;s safety record. I found <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/SectorsAviation/Air-India-is-world-s-third-worst-airline/Article1-999533.aspx">this article</a> claiming they are the 3rd least safe airline in the world, ignoring the ones so unsafe they don&#8217;t count. Who needs bungee jumping when you&#8217;ve got dangerous airlines to travel with.</p>

<p>I got a taxi from the airport to a hotel recommended in the lonely planet (I had nothing planned when my flight took off, so the lonely planet was my only real option), and it was this cute little old school style taxi, just like in old movies, with a bench seat across the front and a roof so low my head nearly touched the roof.</p>

</a></p>

<p>When I arrived I found out that that hotel was full, but a helpful guy looking for a tip helped me find  a place around the corner that was nice and cheap, that was just a floor full of tiny shoebox private rooms, probably 1.5 metres by 2 metres. Good enough lodgings to spend a night, but the bathrooms were so horrible I didn&#8217;t wasn&#8217;t to stay more than the one night.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9579540237/" title="IMG_0479 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="My shoebox.

There are many like it but this one is mine. For tonight.</em>
</a></p>

<p>I was hungry for some dinner so I went for a walk to find that just about everything around seemed to be closed already at 11pm, but after walking past hundreds of shut shops, I found Leopold Cafe; from the book &#8220;Shantaram&#8221;, which saved me from having to stoop to visiting the golden arches I could see in the distance. The place for much larger and far busier than I had imagined it to be, with a whole team of waiters decked out wearing &#8220;Leopold&#8221; uniforms. I had a pretty nice curry there, then headed back to my shoebox to sleep for the evening.</p>

<p>I spent the next morning searching for a nicer hotel that I could afford and found a place that had a bit of an old mansion feel to it. I had a look at the room, it looked pretty nice and had an air conditioner so I agreed to stay, but later when I went to turn on the AC I was disappointed to find there was no power to it. I asked at reception about it and they told me it was an option extra which I wasn&#8217;t very happy with, especially since there was no fly screens on the windows. I ended up deciding that I didn&#8217;t really need the AC, and lucky for me there didn&#8217;t seem to be any mosquitoes in Mumbai.</p>

<p>After sorting out my room, I went and looked into booking a tour of the slums with a company that had been strongly recommended that used the money raised to run a school in the slums to educate the kids there. I was lucky and there was a tour leaving that day in about an hour, so I booked in and went home to change from my flip-flops into closed shoes.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting tour, showing how much industry goes on there from plastic recycling, where they sort the plastic by quality and colour and melt it down to make long strands which are cut into pellets to be shipped off to other countries to be made into all sort of stuff, to fabric recycling where old fabric is shredded and the fibres are spun into a thread which is then turned back into fabric, to burning off the paint from old oil drums and banging them back into shape to be repainted, refilled and reused. Apparently there are a few people making a ton of money from the slums, while the people who work and live there are in extreme poverty. A lot of the people actually sleep at night in the same factory that they work in during the day.</p>

<p>We were taken down a &#8220;lane way&#8221; that would have been only about the width of my shoulders and required us to bend down not because of a low roof, but because of low power lines, along which there were hundreds of tiny rooms each inhabited by a family. At one point we went past an area our guide had described as an open field used by the locals as a toilet. What it looked like, however, was a huge mound of garbage with some kids playing cricket on it not 10 metres away from another kid squatted down taking a dump. Lovely!</p>

<p>The next day I took a boat to Elephanta Island, to see the cave temples carved out of the side of the hill. The boat ride there was pretty choppy on account of the extremely high tides. I had a sea sickness table beforehand so I was fine, but there were a lot of Indian women throwing up onto the side of the boat. That&#8217;s not a typo, they weren&#8217;t managing to get it over the edge in the slightest.</p>

<p>The steps up to the cave were lined on either side by stalls selling the generic tacky souvenirs available everywhere in India, and roofed with blue tarps that did little more than stop any change of a breeze to ease the humidity. I don&#8217;t know how many people come all the way to Elephanta Island to buy their tacky jewelled elephant, or how they would pick any of those hundred basically identical stalls over another, but the shopkeepers obviously think it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>

</a></p>

<p>The first cave was quite impressive, with huge chambers carved from the mountain with lots of statues carved into the walls, but the other unfinished caves were less impressive, and finding a part where the &#8220;stone&#8221; had fallen away to reveal steel concrete reinforcing made me wonder just how authentic the whole place was.</p>

</a></p>

<p>The boat back seemed to take a lot longer than the boat there, with a few burst of monsoon rain, so I didn&#8217;t end up getting back until late in the afternoon and didn&#8217;t do much else that day.</p>

<p>My final day in Mumbai, and in India, was pretty packed full of stuff. I had a look through the museum in the morning before heading out to Mahalaxmi Dhobi Ghat, a huge open air laundry, full of little troughs of water where people bash clothes clean, roofs covered in clothes lines and sheds where they boil water for the washing. It was an interesting place to visit, and explained why hotel laundry in Mumbai needed to be dropped off so early in the day.</p>

</a></p>

<p>After the Laundry, I walked down towards the Haji Ali Mosque, which is out on an island connected to the mainland by a long concrete walkway, with toxic Bombay water full of garbage on either side. I should have turned back when I noticed everyone coming back from the mosque was soaked from head to toe, but instead I took my chances and decided to try and time it right so I could get out to the mosque dry, timing my movement between waves. That was foolish and about half way out I got stuck in a crowd when a large wave hit the concrete wall, splashing up and soaking everything I was wearing with filthy water. It&#8217;s a damn good thing I had my phone and camera in my dry bag at the time!</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9649761121/" title="Haji Ali Mosque by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="Haji Ali Mosque" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/9649761121_7c5f634464_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Haji Ali Mosque</em>
</a></p>

<p>I turned back without even getting to the mosque, and as I was leaving some heavy rain started to fall. While people ran for cover, I tried to find somewhere completely uncovered and took my hat off to try and get a bit rinsed off by the rain.</p>

<p>Next I headed to the Gandhi museum, which in typical fashion was closed that day for pest spraying, so I headed down to nearby Chowpatty beach instead. There was a roped off area along the shore that I asked a local about, and was told it was there to stop people getting sprayed with the toxic seawater from waves&#8230; So it sounds like the water pollution issue isn&#8217;t over-exaggerated at all.</p>

<p>I saw some kids jumping of a higher bit of sand doing flips and stuff, that I watched for a while before they dragged me over to sit with them and asked me questions and wanted me to take photos of them so they could see themselves.</p>

</a></p>

<p>On my long walk along the coastline, back to where I was staying, I was hit by some more dark clouds and heavy rain that I welcomed with open arms. It&#8217;s amazing how getting covered in filthy toxic seawater can change you opinion of how annoying monsoon rain is. I just walked along with a grin on my face, watching people run for cover when there was absolutely no cover to run towards.</p>

<p>I decided I needed a shower before I headed to the airport; I asked at my hotel but they told me there was no shower that I could use, so I went to a hostel around the corner and asked them how much it would cost just to use a shower. They ended up only charging 100 rupees, and I was happy to get cleaned up and changed into some clean clothes.</p>

<p>My taxi driver for the drive to the airport had Bollywood tunes that I could actually recognise playing on the radio, a fitting way to finish up my time in India.</p>

<p>I feel I will definitely be coming back at some point, probably in winter, well away from the monsoon. I can completely understand why the place is so love/hate with people. There&#8217;s a bunch of things about the place that frustrate and confuse me, but the colourful nature of the place, the amazing food and the friendly people (who aren&#8217;t trying to sell you shit) have won me over.</p>

      <p>The next morning half the tour group boarded a train heading to Delhi to finish up their tour, but the 4 of us staying on and Moon went and got a local bus heading to a little village called Nimaj Bagh. The place were were staying was an old palace turned into a hotel, with beautifully painted trims on all the doorways, arches and windows. The place also had a pool which we hung out in all afternoon, making the heat a whole lot more bearable.</p>

</a></p>

<p>We got taken on another village tour, which was quite similar to Tordi Garh, but there was a tiny bit more evidence of western influence and capitalism here, in the form of a few more general store type shops and one place selling tourist trinkets. The kids, however, were just as beautiful and innocent, wanting little more than to see themselves on the screen of our cameras.</p>

</a></p>

<p>We also visited a temple that was decorated with carvings from before the time when Muslims had stated to influence India, with lots of carved women wearing nothing more than a sarong around their waist. It&#8217;s actually a bit sad to think about the changes in India since that time. People are shocked and offended if a woman wears a singlet exposing their shoulders. The country responsible for the inception of the karma sutra is today inhabited by a generation of men who act like primary school boys, titillated by asking if you&#8217;ve had &#8220;the sex&#8221; with your past girlfriends and wanting to high five you. Quite frankly it&#8217;s depressing to see a country that was once so far ahead of the curve in sexual liberation, today being completely sexually retarded and ridiculously conservative.</p>

<p>That evening we drove out to a hill with a lovely view of the sunset, where we had some chai. After the sun set we briefly went to a nearby lake and watched animals before it started to rain quite heavily and we headed back to our jeep and did the sides up before heading back to the hotel for a good nights sleep.</p>

</a></p>

<p>From Nimaj Barh we headed to Jodpur, India&#8217;s blue city. In the old town buildings are pretty much all painted indigo blue, apparently because it keeps the mosquitoes away. We spent the day exploring the Jodpur fort, which was fort-like, with Jodpur influences. Can you tell that my bullet point notes are lacking detail and my memory is failing?</p>

</a></p>

<p>That night we went to a local bar called Rocks bar, where I tried a bunch of local whiskeys, most of which were pretty alright, followed by a bunch of dancing which even in a very drunken state I had a lot of trouble getting into. Oh, and some local guy serving for the navy asked me to go home with him after the music stopped&#8230; just your usual night our in India.</p>

</a></p>

<p>The trip itinerary said the trip to Udaipur was by local bus, but we decided as a group that we&#8217;d done local buses already and would be happy to pay more to be able to make toilet stops wherever we pleased, and save a bunch of time. It also meant we&#8217;d be able to stop at a large Jain temple, the religion that our guide loosely follows. It&#8217;s an interesting religion in that it&#8217;s followers are supposed to shun technology; it&#8217;s monks take it to extremes and only walk to get around, even bikes are apparently to much technology. I&#8217;m told that it means the religion hasn&#8217;t spread very far around the world, simply because it&#8217;s preachers won&#8217;t board planes so can&#8217;t easily spread their beliefs in other countries.</p>

<p>During the drive it was very interesting to see how the landscape changed, starting off extremely dry and desert like, then becoming mountainous and rocky for a while, trailing into lush green rolling hills.</p>

</a></p>

<p>We finally arrived in Udaipur in the late afternoon and drove around the narrow hilly streets of the old city, where we went up lane way only wide enough for one car. As luck would have it a car was coming the other way and we had to back back down to the T-intersection to let it pass. Helpfully cars coming from the other two directions drove right up to our vehicle, stopped and every starting beeping their horns. Cars and tuk-tuks banked up behind them in both directions while impatient motorcycle rides forced their way through the narrow gaps. There was a lot of shouting, and a silly amount of horn usage as though they believed we were unaware they wanted to get past, and they didn&#8217;t realise that other self-centred idiots had blocked us in from every side so until one of the honking idiots yielded, nobody was going anywhere.</p>

<p>Eventually cars and tuk-tuks manoeuvred enough for us to get out of the way of the car coming down the road we wanted to go up, and we did a loop around to the hotel where we were again impatiently honked at by a taxi while we got our bags out.</p>

<p>With how impatient everyone on the roads seems to be, how little consideration people seem to have for how their actions are making things worse, and just how bullshit crazily people seem to drive, I&#8217;m honestly surprised that I didn&#8217;t see any real road rage. Everyone is in a needless hurry, but people seem to keep their cool pretty well.</p>

<p>After checking into our hotel we took a quick walking tour of the surrounding area, and then went on a sunset boat cruise on the lake that took us out past the two &#8220;floating&#8221; hotels that looked very upmarket.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Our guide invited us to come to his home for dinner that evening, where his wife and grandmother had prepared a divine selection of curries. Moon insisted that it was custom for guests to eat before the hosts, so we dug in as they brought the various dishes out, and his little old grandmother who didn&#8217;t speak any English kept sneaking more naan onto our plates. Desert was goolab jamun, delicious doughy balls soaked in rosewater syrup.</p>

</a></p>

<p>While in Udaipur we did a tour of the very beautiful palace, took the cable car up to a lookout where the girls were swarmed by Indians who wanted to take a photo with them (a few even asked me, it was like they&#8217;d never seen white people before), and took in a show of traditional music and dancing one of which involved a woman dancing with an ever growing stack of pots balanced on her head.</p>

</a></p>

<p>There was also some sort of kite flying festival going on while we were in Udaipur, so Moon invited us to his home yet again so would could get up on his roof and try out hand at kite flying, and fighting (trying to cut other people&#8217;s kite string with ours). Quite a fun afternoon!</p>

</a></p>

<p>One morning we were booked in to do a cooking class but I felt extremely nauseated during breakfast and decided food preparation was probably not the best idea. By lunch I was feeling fine again and came to the conclusion that the nausea must have been caused by the doxycycline I&#8217;d taken that morning on an empty stomach, an amateur mistake.</p>

<p>I spent the morning doing research into how to spend my time in South Africa and found a budget tour from Johannesburg to Botswana, which nearly fitted into the time I was there but started a day early. I made some enquires about changing my flight and if there was an seat on the tour, and was soon off trying to get a refund on my overnight train ticket and booking flight to get me to Mumbai sooner to give me a little extra time there.</p>

<p>Moon and the girls still on the tour said our goodbyes and they headed off to get their overnight train back to Delhi, while I stayed on in Udaipur for a few extra days.</p>

      Train stations parties until the little hours of the night - India Part 2

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>The overnight train the second time around, from Varanasi to near Agra, was a bit of an ordeal. We showed up at the station at 21:00, one hour before the train was scheduled to depart at 22:00, and were soon told that the train had been delayed a few hours, now expected at 00:00. We went into the upper class and sleeper class reserved seating area to sit and wait and found it was full of people sleeping on the benches. One of the guys checking people were allowed to be in there went around and woke some people up, clearing enough seats so everyone could at least sit down.</p>

<p>We soon noticed what appeared to be rats lurking in the shadows underneath benches, occasionally making dashes in and out of the toilets. The toilets were a sight to not be seen. Wreaking of shit, the guys toilets consisted of three squats one of which had leaking plumbing that sprayed water at you as you first walked in the door, or went near the basin to wash your hands. How lovely!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The station we were at is quite a busy interchange station, so pretty much every 5 seconds there was an announcement, each preceded by Microsoft&#8217;s tada.wav sound. Not annoying in the slightest. I started watching my watch to measure the silence and got excited where there was no announcement for an entire minute! As 00:30 approached we got word there were further delays, and a later ETA, which when it came to be that time the train didn&#8217;t show and we didn&#8217;t get any new information. The guys who make sure that people in the waiting area are actually allowed there went home and suddenly the room was full of homeless people sleeping on the floor, even under the benches we were sitting on.</p>

<p>Finally at 03:30 our train arrived and we boarded, only 5.5 hours later than planned, and only a few hours before we were supposed to be arriving in Agra, which obviously wasn&#8217;t going to happen. Completely exhausted and out of patience from staying up so late, you can imagine how overjoyed we were to find a guy sleeping in one of our assigned beds, and used blankets and pillows in most of the remaining ones. A conductor kicked the guy out and sorted us out with new bedding and so we could finally get to sleep.</p>

<p>Waking up the next day we were told the train was somehow now every later again so we probably wouldn&#8217;t get to Agra until 16:30 so we&#8217;d be going to the Taj Mahal the next day instead, a fact that made Kim ecstatic as it meant we&#8217;d be there on her birthday!</p>

<p>At 14:30 we suddenly had to get up and get off the train as we&#8217;d arrived near Agra early-late somehow. We were given the option to visit the Red Fort that afternoon which nearly everyone chose to do.</p>

<p>It was a shocking day in Agra, with dark clouds looming, so it was no surprise at all when it started to piss down with rain soon after we arrived at the Red Fort and not stop while we were there. The fort itself was an amazing building, and even seeing it under such awful conditions everyone still really enjoyed it and I personally found it way more impressive and interesting than the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9582002724/" title="P1100813 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="Me at the Red Fort, Agra" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/9582002724_e4e30862b2_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Me at the Red Fort, Agra</em>
</a></p>

<p>That night back at the hotel we met the final two additions to our tour group, Brad and Brad from Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

<p>The next day we got up extremely early and headed to the Taj Mahal. We were pretty much the first people there which gave as a great opportunity to get some nice photos without too many people in them. I found the Taj to be pretty impressive from a distance, but it didn&#8217;t really have much more to it after that initial impression. I&#8217;m glad we got delayed the previous day, as I don&#8217;t think my impression of the Taj would be as good as that of the Red Fort if we&#8217;d been to see it in the heavy rain.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Because of the previous days delays we didn&#8217;t get the local bus that was on the schedule and instead got some private cars; definitely a bonus for what turned out to be a 6 hour drive to Tordi Garh, the old Palace in Tordi Village.</p>

<p>We were greeted by the &#8220;royal&#8221; owner (maybe he was a prince or something? King doesn&#8217;t sound familiar) and had a nice buffet dinner and drinks to celebrate Kim&#8217;s birthday. I was sharing a room with one of the Brads, and not long after going to bed he started to lose his balance and get vertigo every time he laid down and started to freak out a bit exaggerating that he probably had a brain clot or something, so he went off to see our tour guide and came back 10 minutes later looking quite paniced, and told me he was being taken into Jaipur hospital. We&#8217;re told he was ok, but he&#8217;d gone back to Delhi to head home so we didn&#8217;t really get to spend much time with him in the tour group.</p>

<p>In the morning I got up early with a small group and we walked up the hill behind the palace to the site of the old fort to have a look, see the view and have some chai and biscuits. It was a surprisingly challenging walk, from the ground it looked like a 10 minute stroll, but it ended up taking an hour, and the humidity was so high that every inch of fabric I was wearing was drenched in sweat by the time I got back down to the palace.</p>

</a></p>

<p>After getting back we went for a walk through Tordi village guided by the royal dude. Tordi is a tiny little village a few hours outside of Jaipur; small enough that tourists coming to visit still cause the kids to crowd around excitedly, asking for &#8220;one photo&#8221; with their friends and siblings so that they can shyly look at themselves on the screen afterwards. I think in the whole time we were there I didn&#8217;t get asked to buy anything even once, nor did I see a single piece of touristy crap for sale.</p>

<p>It was explained to us how the money raised by allowing people to stay at the palace and from the meals served there is used to help keep the town going, and how they discouraged giving the children lollies or money so that they don&#8217;t start expecting it, and preserve the awesome vibe the place currently has.</p>

<p>We made the drive back into Jaipur and checked into our hotel which was full of winding corridors and stair cases making it an interesting walk from the front door to the rooms that probably took more than 5 minutes.</p>

</a></p>

<p>We went on a quick tour around Jaipur to get our bearings, then headed to the local movie theatre to watch the current big Bollywood hit, &#8220;Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani&#8221;. The theatre itself was a very impressive building, especially on the inside, it felt like a palace. The movie was visually very colourful and entertaining to watch although I was surprised by how few songs there were; it was a 3 hour epic (with intermission) but I think there were only 3 songs in the whole thing. It was a bit tricky to follow what was happening at times since none of it was in English.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I went to the toilet in the intermission and it was crazy. I think I&#8217;ve been in mosh pits less crowded than that tiny room was.</p>

<p>The next day we headed to the Jaipur palace, home to a king with 100 wives to look after his needs. There was a courtyard where him and his many wives would party, all but his first wife who had to stay in a room separate from the others and could only watch. It seemed like a pretty shitty deal for that first wife.</p>

</a></p>

<p>We had our last dinner with the larger tour group that night at a rooftop restaurant that&#8217;s speciality was meat. I had a plate of various BBQ&#8217;d meats and it was delicious.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>I&#8217;m going to prefix this by apologising that it&#8217;s ridiculously long; I really understand that quote &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the length of this letter but I didn&#8217;t have time to write a shorter one&#8221;. I&#8217;m struggling to keep up, this will probably be the last post I write in this format, which is probably for the best. I&#8217;m going to post this as 4 parts as I get the chance, photos will have to wait until I&#8217;m somewhere with reasonable internets.</p>

<p>I arrived in Delhi quite late at night, about 1am, and was very glad to have an airport transfer already organised. The roads of India didn&#8217;t seem too crazy at that time of night, or at least no worse than Vietnam or Cambodia; how little did I know back then. I checked into my hotel, Hotel Perfect, and went straight to bed.</p>

<p>I woke the next day and went out in search of an ATM so I could get some Rupees and some breakfast. The ATM was easy enough, although the maximum withdrawal was less than AUD $200, another win for my overseas-transaction-fee free credit card. I&#8217;d hate to be getting socked with $5-10 foreign ATM fees for every $200 I needed.</p>

<p>Breakfast wasn&#8217;t so easy to find. The area the hotel was in, Karol Barg, seemed to be mostly closed, which seemed a bit silly in a country where it gets so hot to be shut for the coolest part of the day.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A very persistent &#8220;guide&#8221; and his auto-rickshaw driver finally wore me down after following me for about 15 minutes while I walked and failed to find anywhere open with food. They took me to a south Indian street food place where I had dosa and vegetable curry, which was actually really good, so I decided to stick with them for a while and have them show me around Delhi. That turned out to be a bit of a mistake, the next place they took me to a &#8220;handi-craft&#8221; market.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but on day one of visiting a country, before I&#8217;ve seen anything at all of the place, I have no interest in buying kitche souvenirs. Heck, on day 20 after having seen a bunch of the country I still don&#8217;t have the slightest inclination to buy souvenirs, and even less so to buy stuff so generic that you could think it was from anywhere in Asia.</p>

<p>I did a quick walk through, still trying to be polite at this point, but really just wanted to get out of there. Each shopkeeper insisted that I look in his store, &#8220;just looking is ok&#8221;, completely ignorant to the possibility that maybe I just didn&#8217;t want to look at their tacky trinkets.</p>

<p>I went back out to the rickshaw and asked them to take me to a real market, you know, the kind with the big baskets of spices and stuff that might make nice photos. They drove me to another shitty tourist shop (putting market on your sign does not make your shop a market). I was getting fed up with it at this point and didn&#8217;t even get out of the tuk-tuk and asked to be taken somewhere I could buy a chai.</p>

<p>They instead took me to the tourist travel agent to get a &#8220;free map&#8221;, which the guy inside told me cost 500 rupees, so I left empty handed. Next they took me to &#8220;a great place for tea&#8221;, which was another air conditioned tourist shop selling packaged dried tea. I told the guide to stop wasting both our time with tourist traps as I just am not interested, and asked him to take me to the sort of place where he would actually drink chai of a morning. I think he got a bit pissy but the rickshaw driver seemed to finally get it and walked with me down the street 100m to a little hole in the wall where we had tiny little cups of chai masala. It was very yummy, but the plastic cups smaller than shot glasses were not very satisfying</p>

<p>That night I met up with the tour guide, I guy from Udaipur named Mayank, or Moon, the English translation of his name, and the only other person starting the tour in Delhi, Nicolle. It turns out that most people on the tour would meet us in Varanasi, coming down form Nepal. We were briefed on what was planned for the next 2 weeks, filled out some forms and had an early night.</p>

<p>The next day we went on a tour of the old city, and visited a large mosque where they wouldn&#8217;t let Nicolle in at all, and they wanted you to pay $12 to take in a camera, so I went in by myself with no camera for about 5 minutes to see a very plain and uninteresting structure with people who may well have been homeless sleeping all around inside of it and left. Sexism in the name of religion&#8230; another mark against Muslimism in my eyes.</p>

<p>We next went to a Sikh temple, which was much cleaner, more welcoming, more attractive to look at, and was happy to give free meals to anyone regardless of gender, faith or skin colour; a bit of a stark contrast to the Mosque. We learned about how Sikh believers always carry some sort of a knife or spear, and never cut their hair or beards because they believe it shows their wisdom, and how large turbans are actually full of lots of hair. I guess I have got some good beard wisdom going on, but not so good hair wisdom :P</p>

</a></p>

<p>We then had breakfast in a little parantha shop that made some amazing food. I had a cashew nut parantha, a flat bread stuffed with cashews served with some vegetable curries, and it was really something special.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Nicolle and I  went in search of snacks for the overnight train, and made a trip to the police station to make a report about Nicolle&#8217;s camera that was stolen from her the day before.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9075995749/" title="McPunjabi's by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img alt="McPunjabi's" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/9075995749_9628591e4a_c.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive"><br><em>McPunjabi&#8217;s</em>
</a></p>

<p>That night Moon took us to the train station where we boarded our overnight train where we had 3 beds out of a 6 berth sleeper carriage with a few regular Indian people in the other beds. For at least the first few hours the food and drink guys were constantly walking up and down the isle saying &#8220;Chai, chai, chai! garam chai!&#8221; (Hot tea) or &#8220;Omlette, Omlette, Omlette&#8221; and made it seem a bit pointless having brought our own snacks.</p>

<p>I got a pretty decent nights sleep and in the morning (with the train running a few hours late) we arrived in Varanasi. We checked into our hotel and took some time to freshen up.</p>

<p>We went and ate lunch at a very tasty restaurant, then walked down to the ghats. Nicolle and Moon went back to the hotel to relax, I decided to explore a bit more by myself.</p>

<p>I saw some guys getting their head shaved on one of the ghats, my hair was over due for a shaving so I thought why not. I tried to ask how much a few times but they kept replying &#8220;yes, shaving!&#8221; as though they didn&#8217;t understand English and I figured even if they tried to charge me 4x it would still be cheap. The guy rubbed some water into my hair (thinking back, maybe it was holy Ganges water&#8230; I really hope not), opened a new razor in front of me and put it in the straight razor and started shaving away. Once he was done shaving he started insisting on giving me a head massage, then arms, then another one of the guys there started massaging my other arm telling me how lucky I was to be getting massaged by two men. Right&#8230;</p>

<p>To be honest I wasn&#8217;t really enjoying it and just wanted them to stop so I could leave already. When they finally finished, suddenly the guy could understood English much better and wanted 1000 rupees for him, and 1000 rupees for the other guy (about AUD$20 each). I told them where no way in polite terms. They gave me a spiel about how normal price for Indians in 800 rupees (a crock of shit) and that 1000 each was a good price, and more of them started crowding around.</p>

<p>At this point I&#8217;m feeling a bit intimidated since I know they all have cut-throat razors, so I pull out my wallet, and give them all the money in the notes section of my wallet, which because I separate big notes elsewhere, was only 300 rupees. Still a huge ripoff, but a much easier to stomach one. They tell me they&#8217;re still not happy and want me to go to an ATM or to come with me to my hotel so I can get more money. At this point I&#8217;m starting to get pretty mad, but try and keep calm and tell them sorry but that all they&#8217;re getting.</p>

<p>Their tone suddenly changes and they say OK, and ask me if I&#8217;m happy. I tell them no, I feel like you&#8217;ve ripped me off (because they have). They then make me to do a chant with the &#8220;holy man&#8221; sitting under their umbrella, repeating his words after him. For all I know they had me saying &#8220;I&#8217;m a stupid white man and I promise to give you all my money&#8221; in Hindi.</p>

<p>When he finishes he puts a red dot on my forehead as some sort of blessing. Surprise surprise, I&#8217;m now told I have to make a donation for the blessing. I&#8217;ve had enough with keeping calm, I tell them they&#8217;ve already stolen all my money (a lie, but I have no qualms about lying to a pack of thieving liars) and I&#8217;ve had enough of their scamming, I stand up and storm off, half expecting one of them to follow me and rob me.</p>

<p>I try and walk off my anger from being taken advantage of, but the chaotic streets of Varanasi aren&#8217;t really a good setting for calming down so after storming around for a while I end up getting a taxi back to the hotel, going for a swim and writing the rest of the day off to read.</p>

<p>That evening we meet up with the rest of the group coming from Nepal at dinner.</p>

<p>The next morning we get up before sunrise and head to the Ganges for a sunrise boat ride. It&#8217;s supposed to be a slow journey where we are taken down the river by the running water, but the light wind over-powers that and we stay pretty much stationary until after about 20 minutes of not moving the boat boys give up and turn on the boat engine and take us up the river past all of the ghats. A ghat is basically a set of stairs leading to water, from with the locals do many things including bathe, do laundry and cremate their dead.</p>

</a></p>

<p>After a quick Chai on the side of the Ganges when we get back, in single use disposable ceramic cups none the less, Nicolle and I decided to head to the monkey temple which as the name implies is home to a lot of monkeys. The temple was&#8230; really just another temple. But the monkeys were cute and awesome. Unfortunately you&#8217;re not allowed to take cameras inside at all, which is a shame since I had zero interest in photographing their holy shrine of flaking paint, but would have loved to get some photos of the baby monkeys and their mothers.</p>

<p>Afterward we went for a wander about the street markets, where I took a photo of a guy charming a snake. I went to walk off and the guy stopped playing his flute, picked up his snake basket and started chasing after me and demanding money. I told him to put down the damn snake before giving him a few rupees.</p>

</a></p>

<p>That evening we went on another boat ride where we attempted to float little leaf boats with wish candles in them down the river, but the wind quickly extinguished everyone&#8217;s wishes. India can be a cruel place :P</p>

</a></p>

<p>We then came back and watched a prayer ceremony on the ghat from the boat</p>

</a></p>

<p>I ended up deciding I was overdue for a &#8220;weekend&#8221; the next day, and it was a day leading into an overnight train to be followed by the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort in Agra, so I chose to sit by the pool (accommodation on this tour was far fancier than I&#8217;m used to) and read for the day to relax and recuperate.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>My first day in Thailand I flew into Koh Saumi and got a minibus transfer to Chaweng beach. After looking at a few places that seems pretty average for the price, and generally remembering how nasty Chaweng was, I found some free wifi and looked up some places on Trip Advisor and decided to head to Lamai beach and try a few places there.</p>

<p>After having a few taxi&#8217;s try and ask for ludicrous amounts for the trip to the first place on my list, claiming that the place I wanted to go was way past Lamai, I finally got a motorbike taxi who would take me for a reasonable price&#8230; until one of the asshole taxi drivers came over and told him that the place I wanted to go to wasn&#8217;t in Lamai. But what I do know, I&#8217;m just a stupid foreigner who&#8217;s got the address here stating it&#8217;s in Lamai, and Google maps showing me it&#8217;s there. In the end he agreed to take me for 50% more then we&#8217;d originally agreed, and I was fed up screwing around so I accepted.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Riding on the bag of a motorbike with a reasonably heavy pack making you back-heavy isn&#8217;t all that fun, I spent the ride holding on like my life depended on it because it, no helmets for passengers in Thailand :/</p>

<p>Some ominous dark clouds overhead started to dump down half way to Lamai so we stopped under the awning of a 7-11 for half an hour until it eased up (but didn&#8217;t stop) and then rode on. As the sun was setting we went past a nice beach which I would later find out was Lamai, where I would end up staying, but first we needed to ride for another half hour off to the middle of nowhere to a place that had a similar but different name. Along the way the driver would stop and ask people on the side of the road direction, I&#8217;d show them the map on my phone indicated we&#8217;d passed it already and they&#8217;d tell the motorbike driver that it was still further on.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/432b7918eb3f5068412e504f32388f42/tumblr_inline_mp7sx6xLtN1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Rainy Koh Samui</em></p></p>

<p>We finally got to the place that and I asked to lady at reception to please explain to the driver this was the wrong place, which she was amazingly helpful in doing so. So back on the bike in the rain for half an hour back in the other direction and I finally got to the first place I was planning on looking at. It was already 8:30pm so I didn&#8217;t bother looking elsewhere. I paid the motorbike driver and he asked me for more &#8220;for the extra driving&#8221;. I told him no way in hell, he&#8217;d already charged me 50% more and wasted most of my night taking me to the wrong place and ignoring me telling him we&#8217;d gone past it.</p>

<p>The place was a pretty nice enough resort, not too crowded and almost entirely touristed by Germans. I spent a day just lazing around reading and relaxing in the cool sea breezes, a lovely contrast to the heat of Cambodia. Funnily enough I ate dinner that night at a market of street food vendors with a Welsh couple who had lived on Koh Samui for a few years now, who complained that it was too hot to do anything during the day and were out having a ride around the island at night because it was the only time they thought it was cool enough.</p>

<p>That day in Samui has changed my opinion of the place quite a bit. I still think Chaweng is an awful shithole, but Lamai seemed like a much nicer place and I would have happily spent quite a bit more time there. Maybe it was just because it was low season, but it seemed way more relaxed, and a lot more beautiful at Lamai and it makes me want to see what other parts of the island are like. Next time I guess!</p>

<p>The next day I got the ferry to Koh Tao, and had a hard time trying to find any accommodation in my budget at all, let alone a nice place. I didn&#8217;t realise at the time, but the full moon party had happened on Koh Pha Ngan the weekend before I arrived, after which the throngs of party goers flooded the nearby islands booking just about everywhere. Fuck full moon parties.</p>

<p>I found a &#8220;resort&#8221; that actually had a free room, but to call it a resort would be far to generous. The room was only half finished, nearly completely bare and very overpriced. There were no screens on the windows and it only had a fan, not a great combination for someone who mosquitoes love. To top that off, I seemed to be the only tenant.</p>

<p>I went to the Koh Tao Central Hostel, and met one of the guys who run the place, Rolf, and he gave me a quick tour of the hostel which was significantly cheaper than where I was, was air conditioned, was only new (so everything is working and clean) and actually offered the chance to meet people, so I got myself booked in for the next available night.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/dd3a72a70ec8e073ad57a6c638b4f264/tumblr_inline_mp7sqhbuRQ1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Koh Tao Central Hostel</em></p></p>

<p>I had a drink and wrote some stuff in my book at a bar over the road. While I was there a nice girl named Lianne sparked up a conversation and I found out she was learning to dive with crystal, the place I originally got certified at. She asked about accommodation, already planning where she&#8217;d stay after the free accommodation from the course ran out, and I gave the hostel a plug. A bit later after she&#8217;d left Rolf from the hostel came over and had a beer, wanting to know how I&#8217;d found out about the hostel and if I had any ideas for the place. Apparently it only opened a few weeks earlier, and he was quite keen to make it a success so he was asking for feedback or improvement ideas pretty much every time I saw him.</p>

<p>I started diving with master divers, the no. 1 rated outfit on Trip Advisor. It seemed priced a little bit high, but the price came down retrospectively the more dives you did with them. The staff there were lovely, but because they were a small shop and it was low season the boats only go out once a day, and mostly to open water suitable sites (almost nothing deeper than 18M).</p>

<p>After a few days I decided to seek out shops day to day, based on where there boats were going. I went back to Crystal where I first learned to dive and got to Dive Chumphon Pinnacle, one of the nicest sites in Koh Tao, and the HTMS Sattakut a scuttled navy war ship. Saw loads of yellow tail barracuda, titan trigger fish, banner fish, angel fish&#8230; the list in my log book is too long to keep going.</p>

<p>The day after I booked in with another little shop who were doing their weekly run out to Sail Rock, which is said to be the best site in the area, but it&#8217;s a 2 hour boat trip to get to so the shops don&#8217;t go there so regularly. Sea-sick tablets kept me feeling fine for the whole trip, the two dives there were awesome, although the visibility was much worse than anywhere closer to Koh Tao.</p>

<p>The next shop I went to were once again going to Chumphon and Green rock. I managed to spot lots of very tiny sea-life on the rocks, and a few juvenile banner fish which were so damn cute. The staff were all super friendly and I expressed interest in going to South-West pinnacle, and they told me it was pencilled in for 2 days time so they put my name down for that and locked in that as the site for that day.</p>

<p>South-West was where I did my first deep dive during my Advanced Open Water, and revisiting it was just as I remembered it. A huge pinnacle covered in anemones, swarming with pink clown fish. We dropped right down to just above the sand and circled around a bit on the sea floor and managed to find some Cobias (They look like sharks, except they&#8217;re technically a fish).</p>

<p>I liked the shop a lot and had been thinking about getting a few more certifications (since they&#8217;re cheap on Koh Tao, and could be useful diving elsewhere), so when I found out they had a package for the very 3 specialities I&#8217;d been thinking about, plus accommodation at a cheaper price than anywhere else I&#8217;d been I decided it was meant to be. I did the 6 dives over 3 days and got my Deep speciality allowing me to go to 40M, my Nitrox speciality allowing me to use Air enriched with extra oxygen allowing longer dives without decompression, and my wreck speciality, allowing me to explore inside of wreck and taught me how to lay line in order to find my way out again in case of complete loss of visibility.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d originally had vague intentions of diving on Koh Tao for 6-7 days, then heading to the Phuket side for the remaining part of my time, but after hearing how bad the weather was from a few people, and peoples general dislike of Phuket from a few people I ended up staying on Koh Tao for &#8220;just one more night&#8221; until the very day before my flight out, and got the night boat and a bus to get to Phuket and head straight to the airport.</p>

<p>The night boat was quite an experience! You show up and give them your ticket and they assign you a &#8220;bed&#8221;, where the beds are numbered mattresses on the floor on either side of the boat, barely wide enough to lie down flat on without touching the shoulders of the person next to you. I got bed 1, which meant I only had a person on one side of me and some railings on the other side. I had a Valium and read for a while before getting drowsy and donning eye shades (best thing ever for a traveller, I got fancy shaped ones of ebay for $3 that don&#8217;t actually touch your eyelids and black everything out) and promptly drifting off to sleep.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/453c5ec287a93f35c05636633231b796/tumblr_inline_mp7srjvVsa1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>The Night Boat</em></p></p>

<p>I woke up a few times throughout the night and my gosh were the seas choppy. It felt like the boat was swaying around quite considerably and at one point a big wave hit the side of the boat and came in some of the windows at the other end, resulting in some suddenly awake screams of shock from some people who got wet by it.</p>

<p>I noted at one point that I could see a few life-jackets, but also that I could see that the number I could see was far less than the 70-80 odd people on board. That&#8217;s the sort of thing you notice and then try to ignore.</p>

<p>We arrived at Surat Thani safe and sound, and early! There was a minivan that took us too a bus stop where we waited for an hour. A tuk-tuk/jeep thingy finally arrived to take the passengers to Phuket, thankfully only for about 10 minutes to another shop where we could buy breakfast and wait for another hour for the bus.</p>

<p>The actual bus arrived, a nice coach, and proceeded to drive for another 10 minutes before stopping &#8220;for more passengers&#8221; (who never turned up) for another hour! Once we finally left there we continued on with no more stops, and the bus was so empty that I was able to lie down flat on one of the bench seats towards the back and sleep for a lot of the journey.</p>

<p>We arrived in Phuket town bus station, where it was pissing down with rain. I asked about shuttles to the airport and was told they left from further in town but I could get a taxi for nearly as much as the whole journey from Koh Tao had cost me.</p>

<p>I went and got some lunch and waited for a few hours but the rain didn&#8217;t ease up, and I didn&#8217;t find anyone else wanting to go to the airport, so I eventually got a Taxi there myself.</p>

<p>Check-in was a bit of an ordeal. I&#8217;d looked up what desks were supposed to be for my flight to India, got a trolley and waited there reading, expecting to be first in line. As I waited, probably 100 noisy Indians in very large groups arrived, with mountains of luggage and flat screen TVs, and queued up at desks, but none of them behing me. I should have realised something was up, but I went and checked the screen a few times and the desk I was at was definitely supposed to be for my flight.</p>

<p>When the info finally came up on the screens above the desks it turned out my line was business class. Bugger! I figured I was screwed either way so I kept waiting there for the gates to open in the hope they might check me in anyway, but after they finally started checking in people, there was no staff member for the business class desk anyway, so I had to go to the back of the line; no offer from the huge groups who&#8217;d queue up well after me to check in my single passenger with a single bag.</p>

<p>After waiting for a while in a line that didn&#8217;t move (it takes a long time to check in a group of 20) I got fed up and wandered over to the queueless desks for the same airline I was flying with that said &#8220;all flights&#8221; above them and asked if all flights included my flight, which seemed to had been singled out with its own desks for some reason.</p>

<p>I was extremely happy to find out it did, so I snuck back and grabbed my bags from the other queue and went and checked straight in, finishing before even the first group from the long queue was done! Huzzah for being observant and asking questions. Emergency row with extra legroom to boot!</p>

<p>Onward to India!</p>

      Wake Up Call

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>On this day, one year ago today, I woke up a little bit late.</p>

<p>I rode to work in a bit of a hurry, and on my way got cut off by a car. Getting cut off by cars happens pretty much every day, but on this day I had new brakes that I was unfamiliar with, which were significantly more effective than my old ones. That combined with rushing to not be late, meant that braking hard got me up on just the front wheel and then sent me over the handle bars, landing hard enough on my knees that I got several fractures in my acetabulum (ie. my Hip socket/pelvis).</p>

<p>This moment, at five to nine in the morning on a Friday, changed my life in a number of unexpected ways. Being completely crippled and dependant on others got me seriously thinking about the things I&#8217;d like to do but had been putting off until &#8220;the right time&#8221;, many of which are dependant on being able-bodied, and I wondered a lot about how well I would recover and how those things I&#8217;d like to do might now never happen.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My being such a burden put extra strain on my relationship with Kelly, and I believe at least in some part contributed to it&#8217;s demise.</p>

<p>Right at the peak of things going to shit, Amanda and Miss Fish came around and cooked me dinner and tried to lift my spirits. In what was probably just an off-hand comment, trying to distract me Amanda said I should go to Africa with her and the small group that were planning on going in July 2013.</p>

<p>Having several times in the past put faith in Amanda organising awesome trips, which have always been amazing, I said I was interested without really thinking too much about the logistics of it.</p>

<p>As the days went by and I read through the trip itinerary I decided it was exactly the sort of thing I needed at that time, something to look forward to, so I called up her travel agent and got signed up without even requesting annual leave from work first.</p>

<p>When I started thinking about leave, I realised that the 5 week trip was already a week more leave than I get in a whole year, and with my usual habit of taking a day or two off around festivals and a few days to visit my parents most years it was more like 2 years worth of leave; or a whole lot of unpaid leave.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seemed like if I was paying all that money to get to Africa, it would be silly not to go and see and other nearby stuff, like visiting the pyramids and diving in the red sea. Once my mind was in Egypt, it seemed the next logical step would be that I should go visit my brother in France. And from France it was only a small hop to England to visit Matty Poppins. Being in Europe, I&#8217;d always wanted to spend some more time in Spain and try and learn Spanish&#8230; and by this point I was already thinking in large numbers of months of time required.</p>

<p>I thought for a long time if I should try and ask work for that much time off, or if I should scale back my plans, but both seemed to have major downsides. Either I&#8217;d miss out on doing some stuff I wanted to do, or I&#8217;d have a deadline to be back home by, meaning I wouldn&#8217;t have the flexibility to chop and change my plans at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>Eventually I decided that I should quit my job. That was an incredibly hard choice, because I actually really loved my job (although I&#8217;m sure I was hovering pretty close to burn-out), got along well with the people I worked with, and liked the company I worked for. In a world where it&#8217;s common for people to hate what they have to do to get the money they need to live, it felt pretty irresponsible to leave such a comfortable position.</p>

<p>Having been on the road for over a little while now, I&#8217;m pretty certain it was the right choice. I&#8217;m  feeling tremendously privileged to be able put &#8220;real life&#8221; on the shelf for a while and treat life as the adventure it should be.</p>

<p>Twelve months on from that day in June, my life hardly even resembles what it used to be. I&#8217;m pretty much completely recovered from the injury (only occasional minor tight muscle pain these days and even that is lessening) and taking full advantage of that every day. Instead of worrying about being late for work or if the thing I was working on is going to get finished on time, my concerns today are along the lines of &#8220;What should I spend my last day in India doing?&#8221; and &#8220;I hope I get a window seat for my flight to South Africa.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always thrived under pressure and I almost feel like last year was life&#8217;s way of saying &#8220;Hurry up and do awesome things, you can&#8217;t wait forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe that the adventure I&#8217;ve set out on will solve all (or even any) of the problems in my life, but it certainly hasn&#8217;t made things worse yet. Maybe when I&#8217;m old I&#8217;ll look back and wish I&#8217;d been sensible, and invested my savings more wisely, so I could die having a larger sum of money to leave to the children I&#8217;m not really planning on having&#8230;. but I seriously doubt it.</p>

      Airport security in India

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>I&#8217;m jumping out of order for a bit for a quick story about the joys of security theater in Indian airports.</p>

<p>I get dropped off at the airport by a taxi and head towards the door in which I can see signs pointing to departures and arrivals. I go to enter and the security guy on the door, holding what I think was an MP-5 machine gun, wants to see ticket and passport. Having only booked my ticket online hours earlier and having no printer I had no ticket to show him. He says I can show him on my phone, I pull up Trip-It and show him the flight details and confirmation number but he&#8217;s not happy because there&#8217;s no name listed so he sends me around to the ticket desk to get a ticket printed. After trying the next two entrances in the direction he gestured I realise the desks are basically just invisible slots in the glass front of the building.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/c4788b345ab4feb2d6068e42b1a3a8af/tumblr_inline_mp223quYeM1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>The &#8220;ticket desk&#8221;</em></p></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a guy in there on his phone, but he doesn&#8217;t look over when I say nameste, nor when I knock on the window. A rather stressed out looking Indian man comes over and tries as well but the guy inside completely ignores both of us. Nice to know it&#8217;s not just because I&#8217;m a foreigner.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Finally, after waiting at the window for ages wondering if maybe I got there too late, another guy shows up in the window. I read out the confirmation number and he asks me to pass my phone in through the slot. I&#8217;m not keen on this, but don&#8217;t have another option, and he gives it back after entering something in his computer. He disappears for 5 minutes, then comes back and asks for my passport. He writes some stuff on a scrap of paper, stamps it and hands it to me.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/02c46cf105235e680b369095becfc110/tumblr_inline_mp227gohr21qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>My &#8220;ticket.&#8221; Good enough for security!</em></p></p>

<p>I go back to the front door (keeping in mind, everything so far has occurred with me being completely outside the airport) this time armed with my hand written piece of paper; and this time I&#8217;m allowed in.</p>

<p>I walk the 20 metres towards the departure check-in part of the airport, and a guy at the entrance stops me and asks to see my ticket and passport yet again. Obviously the guys out the front can&#8217;t be trusted. He&#8217;s concerned that the hand written scrap of paper only says Bombay on it and doesn&#8217;t mention Udaipur. So another guy is called over to confirm that yes, my flight does actually leave from the airport I&#8217;ve shown up at. Phew!</p>

<p>I put my check-in bag on an x-ray machine conveyor belt, and at the other end it is stickered and looped with packing tape.</p>

<p>I finally get to the check-in desk. You know? The place where all of this stuff happens at real airports. There is no line. They take my hand written ticket and print me off a boarding pass. It sure is lucky they had security to check my hand-written unforgeable scrap of paper several times before letting me through here. I&#8217;d hate to think what horrible things might have occurred without all that &#8220;security&#8221;.</p>

<p>In order to get to the boarding area, I have to show my boarding pass and passport yet again. Surprisingly they&#8217;re not interested in checking my hand written ticket here as well. They are, however, concerned that my carry on bag has no paper tag on it, so they stop me while they find one and attach it to my bag.</p>

<p>I put my bag, laptop and contents of my pockets in plastic trays and send them through the x-ray machine, then line up behind 2 other guys at the step through metal detector, which seems to be going off for everyone.</p>

<p>There is a second metal detector, but it&#8217;s only for women, so I stand in this queue, starting to feel a bit uncomfortable how long my stuff is out of my sight and loose in a tray.</p>

<p>Each person in front of me sets off the metal detector, and then has to stand on a platform for a pat-down and a scan hand held metal detector that&#8217;s so over-sensitive it goes off for zippers.</p>

<p>I walk through the metal detector and it doesn&#8217;t go off. Huzzah! I&#8217;m still required to take the second metal detector scan and pat-down. Makes me wonder why they even have the step through one, but I already know the answer. Because more is obviously better.</p>

<p>At last I get over to the plastic tray containing my stuff, and find my bag has been taken aside. This means I have to wait for 10 minutes while one of the security people go through the bag of the man in front of me, and tell him to throw out his two containers of milk(?) in soft drink bottles. Meanwhile, 3 security people stand around doing nothing as there&#8217;s no more bags to x-ray.</p>

<p>Finally it&#8217;s my turn, I&#8217;m told to pull out <em>all</em> electronics from my bag, and lighters. They&#8217;re very certain I have a lighter and it needs to be scanned separately. I have no such lighter and I tell them several times, with them asking again probably 4-5 times.</p>

<p>My carry-on bag is nearly solely electronics. I empty everything out into a plastic tray, leaving some books and my passport wallet in the bag for them to rescan separately. Now I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s ok to re-pack my bag. They stamp the paper tag and ask for my boarding pass in order to write something down in their report.</p>

<p>At boarding, my ticket is scanned by one person, then a metre later it is checked by another guy who also wants to see my passport, and then again as I enter the plane a third man wants to tear off the stub of the ticket.</p>

<p>Good work India, another terrorist plot of boarding an airplane without having to jump through lots of unnecessary hoops has been foiled! Inconvenience and the illusion of added security continues it&#8217;s reign.</p>

      Mountain Biking in Siem Reap

<p>On my last day in Siem Reap I decided to rent myself a mountain bike and pedal myself out to the ruins. The flatness of the countryside made riding a little easier, but the heat was certainly challenging. I rode in to Angkor Thom, the largest of all the ancient sites, and headed for the east gate (not the victory gate, which is also on the east wall, which is the one the roads pass through).</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/be50972d0516e2bcc7b43a1a4cdc14fd/tumblr_inline_modqtj1cNW1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Angkor Thom&#8217;s east gate</em></p></p>

<p>The trail leading up to it was rough and bumpy with lots of large rocks and didn&#8217;t seem like it got too much traffic. Upon reaching the gate, I was met by the spectacular sight of the massive gate poking out of the jungle, without a huge clearing around both sides as all the other gates seem to have. I got off my bike and explored for a bit, and sat down to reapply sunscreen and got hassled by a bunch of butterflies that just kept on landing on me and my stuff, the bullies!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/797308c9dd30edd23149e1f3b8b66404/tumblr_inline_modqu4xYgb1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Butterflies everywhere!</em></p></p>

<p>Just as I was nearly leaving I saw the first other people since I left the main roads; what appeared to be two people and a tour guide, also on mountain bikes, heading off through the gate. This gave me confidence to continue down the path a few minutes later when I had my stuff together and was ready to leave.</p>

<p>The path got narrower and narrower, eventually getting to parts where I was going through mud, barely fitting the bike between bushes, and was dropping down flat with the handlebars to fit under branches. I started to think maybe I&#8217;d missed a turn or something, and wonder just how well cleared the area was of landmines, but I figured that an obvious path wouldn&#8217;t be there if there were still mines about. Finally I found the paths end, coming out just down the road from Ta Promh, exactly where I wanted to go to next!</p>

<p>As I approached I noticed a dirt road along the south wall which I followed along to the south gate past some stunning sections of wall being slowly destroyed by trees. Since there was nobody there to stop me, I headed on into the temple grounds on my bike and followed some weaving tracks right in to the main ruins in the center, and then out again to the collapsed north gate.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/4954f6fd99a4f3730eeb8b3863847415/tumblr_inline_modr0mtuMr1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Trees make short work of man&#8217;s feeble walls</em></p>

<p>By this time I was drenched with litres of sweat and feeling very dehydrated, so I made the drink sellers at one of the temple entrances happy by buying several bottles of water and a coconut. I sat and drank, and I took my shoe and socks off and hung the socks over the bike in a effort to dry them a bit while I rested. I need to remember to take spare socks if I do this sort of thing again.</p>

<p>I looked at my map to get my bearings, and decided to go to Preah Khan next. There was an obvious long way there via road, but there was also some roads the looked close together that I suspected I&#8217;d be able to find a trail between. Along my way to the road I passed another cycle tour going the other way and asked their guide if there were any trails linking the two roads on my map. At first he said I should go the long way because there was no road and I might get lost, but after I told him about my earlier adventures on tiny walking tracks he told me there was a walking trail but still warned I might get lost. This sounded like a challenge, and I actually don&#8217;t mind being lost.</p>

<p>I headed along the actual road looking for a trail, I passed something that I thought might be it but wasn&#8217;t sure, so i went a fair way past it until I hit a bridge from the map and knew I had gone to far, so I doubled back. Even the &#8220;road&#8221; was very rough with many huge rocks making for a bumpy ride, interspersed with sand that made the bike slide all over the place.</p>

<p>I headed into the jungle along the trail and it quickly became apparent that this one really was an infrequently used walking trail. The gaps in the foliage were even tighter here than the last off-road trail I followed, and a good number of steps made from large rocks gave the bikes suspension a good workout. Very glad I opted for the mountain bike at this point.</p>

<p>I came to a few forks in the road and tried to pick the ones that i thought would keep me going in generally the right direction, until eventually I came to a creek maybe 2 meters wide and 30-40 cm deep. There were a few small tree branches laid across it like a very shonky bridge, but even they were under a few cm of water.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/7171aec1e4c35a6eee2e7ab7cb2ce21f/tumblr_inline_modqubun8z1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>The &#8220;bridge&#8221; I crossed</em></p></p>

<p>Now was one of those moments where I thought I should really turn back, but stubbornly pushed on anyway. I definitely wasn&#8217;t game to try and ride across, but I figured maybe I could walk across it carrying the bike. I rested the bike on its own log to trying and distribute the weight a bit and stop me breaking the one I was standing on. The logs flexed quite a bit and I was very thankful that my shoes were waterproof as they got pretty well submerged, but I made it across without any mishaps, and thought &#8220;well, there&#8217;s no turning back now&#8221;.</p>

<p>After riding a little further the path started to widen up a bit and after a while longer I finally came to a wall. Hooray! I followed the wall for what seemed like a very long time, passing many ruined patches destroyed by beautiful trees, while the creek to my right got wider and wider until I must have been 15 metres across.</p>

<p>Part way along the wall I came across a section that was being reconstructed/restored by a group of ~20 Thai men, who at first seemed a bit startled that someone was coming from the direction I came from, and then greatly amused it was a foreigner. In hindsight I probably should have stopped and observed a bit more, and taken some photos of how they manage to move all the large blocks (not a crane in sight), but I felt like I was somewhere I probably wasn&#8217;t supposed to be, in the middle of a construction site so I rode on until I finally found the entrance gate.</p>

<p>I entered, thinking it was odd that there was no ticket inspector at the gate, and rode on for a bit thinking that this didn&#8217;t look anything like I remembered Preah Khan looking, and then realised too that I was riding on an actual bitumen road, so I definitely wasn&#8217;t where I thought I was. I passed a roadside distance marker that indicated I was heading towards the Bayon temple; I had a look at my map and deduced I was now riding in the wrong direction along the &#8220;long route&#8221; that I chose not to follow earlier.</p>

<p>It turns out that the &#8220;creek&#8221; that I crossed is one of the now very narrow parts of the moat of Angkor Thom, and I had snuck into the old city without even realising. that section of the wall that I followed was 1.5KM by itself, compared to the 800M total length of the wall of Preah Khan that I thought I was following.</p>

<p>I turned around and headed to Preah Khan, but they wouldn&#8217;t let me take my bike inside so I had to lock it up outside. A bit of a bullshit double standard, when all the locals hawking shit are allowed in on their overburdened motorbikes. I don&#8217;t think they should be allow in to hawk their shitty T-shirts and postcards at all, but that&#8217;s a whole other rant.</p>

<p>On this visit I almost completely avoided the inside of the center part of the temple, preferring to explore the other ruins, free from tourists and hawkers. I found some amazing tree roots with a gap tall enough for me to stand under with my arms stretched up, and another tree that completely covered the top of a building, surrounded by walls and rubble so I couldn&#8217;t get a good view of it.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/669eab9c71fb2cc61ccce61ced72600e/tumblr_inline_modqvbO9K41qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>These tree roots were epic!</em></p></p>

<p>I ended up scaling part of the inner wall about 3 metres high, behind a &#8220;danger - do not pass&#8221; sign, in order to get a good look and a photo. So keep in mind that if I die travelling, chances are it was me being curious and a little reckless, and probably my own fault :P</p>

<p>I rode back home, with a quick stop to watch some monkeys playing on some ruins inside Angkor Thom, which was very entertaining until the alpha male attacked another male in the group, leaving a huge bloody gash across it&#8217;s face. A good reminder that they&#8217;re not really as fun and playful as they often appear.</p>

<p>That pretty much sums up my mountain bike adventures.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some bonus photos of monkeys checking out my bike from earlier in the day :D</p>

      <p>Upon arriving at Duong Dong Airport in Phu Quoc I got a taxi to my hotel, the A74. I checked in and was shown to my room by a very friendly concierge. The room smelt a bit funny so went back down and asked if I could change rooms and they put me in a much bigger room, which still has some odd odour in it that I cant identify but I guess the whole place might have that smell.</p>

<p>I did some washing in the bathroom sink and nearly accidentally tore it off the wall. it turns out it was only held up by the plumbing and two flimsy little brackets, which I bent a bit (and then bent back as well as I could).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I went for a walk towards the main part of town and stumbled across the night markets, where all kinds of fresh seafood was available to be purchases and BBQ&#8217;d up for you there on the spot, along with some fruit stalls and souvenir stalls.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/a244205bd4efddb9db28dd7b127fb0ce/tumblr_inline_mnkhc4W4ob1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>The night markets</em></p></p>

<p>I found a place that made avocado smoothies, one of the amazing discoveries from last time I was in Vietnam and was happy to find it was just as tasty as I remembered.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/1cafd4d42f7809e636f3b36dc6c56a39/tumblr_inline_mnkh8l1Tmb1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Avacado smoothies are da bomb</em></p></p>

<p>I bought some squid that was fresh enough that you could poke it and it&#8217;s skin pulsed through different colours and a garlic sea snail. The squid was divine but I&#8217;m not so sure about the texture of the sea snail.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic and friendly guy who talked me into buying from him told me he&#8217;s a guide during the day and offered to take me around the island on his motorbike tomorrow. His name was Nsit and he seemed like a good guy so I agreed.</p>

<p>After I ate I bought some fruit with a name I&#8217;m not sure of. As I was paying I got distracted by a very young beggar boy, who I ended up giving some of my change, but in the process forgot to actually take the fruit I paid for with me :(</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/fdea4440755bca3bcb7a7ef1a561eb66/tumblr_inline_mnkhfclDlK1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>I love fruit stalls in tropical countries</em></p></p>

<p>I got a motorbike home and chilled out in my room for the night. After about half an hour it bucketed down with rain, prompting me to check the forecast for the next day and it didn&#8217;t look great. 70% chance of rain and thunderstorms. Maybe a day for me to go without my phone and camera, wear contacts and take a rain jacket and expect to get really wet!</p>

<p>I woke up the next morning and could hear from the traffic going past that the roads were still wet. I looked outside and saw that the sky was overcast and it was spitting a little. Bugger! I started to wonder if it was even worth going if it was going to be wet all day, but Nsit arrived at 8am as we&#8217;d agreed so I grabbed my bag + a rain jacket and jumped on the back of his bike. There were a few drops here and there but not enough to merit putting on the rain coat. It sure did look miserable though, but at least it was cooler.</p>

<p>First stop was a winery that makes wine out of a fruit called the sim. I got to taste a few types, mostly very sweet wines. I felt a bit pressured to buy something, so bought a small bottle that was only $5. Nsit led me out into the orchard and we found some of the fresh fruit for me to try.</p>

<p>We got back on the bike and headed off down a red dirt road, which was a bit scary with the recent rain meaning lots of mud and puddles, but I&#8217;m told the rain actually makes the road better so I&#8217;d hate to see how it is normally.</p>

<p>We stopped at a pearl farm, and where shown some oysters being opened and the pearls cut out of them. I did the expected walk around with zero interest in buying anything. I&#8217;m not into jewellery in the in first place, but pearls just seem very old fashioned to me. We left that place went went down the road to another one which I wasnt at all interested in and ended up taking more interst in the beach the farm was next to and the sheer amound of rubbish on it. A sad sight to see, which makes me appreciate the hard work by the people who go along the main beaches each day picking up all the new rubbish that&#8217;s washed to shore.</p>

<p>The sun started to come out and we got back on the bike for a much longer ride to the coconut tree prison, which depicted horrible acts committed by the &#8220;USA&#8221; and the south. There were small barbed wire cages called &#8220;tiger cages&#8221; that they&#8217;d put prisoners in wearing very few clothes in the hot sun, so that pretty much any time they moved they got gashed by the barded wire. There were maniquens set up showing some of the torture they did, burning prisoners genitals, driving nails through ankles, crushing their chest between two boards and even removing their kneecaps. Pretty messed up stuff. There was also an impressive tunnel on display that prisoners had dug out in order to escape.</p>

<p>The next stop was right across the road, the fish sauce factory. It was interesting to see just how manual the processing there was. There were big open vats being filled so they could be filtered, and a person bottling the sauce by hand with a hose and a heat-gun to heatshrink the seals around the lids on.</p>

<p>Next stop was Sao beach. I walked up and down the beach taking a few photos, and found the sun had gotten really fierce now. I could hardly see at all without my sunglasses but I&#8217;d opted to wear contacts this day so there were not an option initially. Where all the sunglasses guys now, hey? I accidentally rubbed a contact out of my eye at one point, so i switched to prescription sunnies and things were a lot more pleasant. I went for a nice swim in the lovely warm water with a large number of Vietnamese tourists, and not another westerner to be seen. Afterward I set on a deck chair in the shade on the beach and had delicious shrimp and cashew nuts for lunch.</p>

<p>After a few hours we headed off towards a temple along some rather sketchy roads, which I filmed a very shaky video of for a bit. The temple was in a beautiful location up on the hill overlooking the coast.</p>

<p>Last planned stop for the day was a pepper farm. I got to eat some green peppercorns fresh from the tree, which have quite a delayed kick to them. I nibbled on one and thought it wasn&#8217;t that hot so I chewed on the rest of it and it suddenly got very hot indeed.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/de93b3192f342c197b76a619855cce86/tumblr_inline_mnlbnhGAZZ1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Pepper!</em></p>

<p>At one point a large group of Vietnamese tourist started trying to whack down some fruit from high up in a tree with piece of bamboo, which Nsit told me was apparently very sour. A little 11 year old boy shared some of the odd sour fruit with me and commented on my 1UP mushroom hanging off my bag, so later I got some ripe berries for him from one of the trees that were too high for anyone else to reach. He was from HCMC and spoke great English.</p>

<p>On the way back to my hotel Nsit offered that we could visit his home. It was interesting to see how the locals live. The place was fairly basic but well cared for, and had cool fences surrounding the block made of cactus :)</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/5b83a2026f5c19635806d58bf357bb8b/tumblr_inline_mnm2ahXt7p1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Nsit&#8217;s house</em></p>

<p>His family was very friendly, I got a nice photo of him and his dad who works as a snail fisherman. The house was built as lots of separate buildings of different ages, instead of one single dwelling that was added to over time. Nsit tells me he has 6 sibblings but only him and his brother are still at home with the parents, the rest have all married and moved out.</p>

<p>Nsit dropped me off at my hotel and I gave him some money. He&#8217;d told me the night before to pay what I thought at the end, and I&#8217;d had a good day so I ended up giving him 500K dong, which after spending a week in Vietnam I&#8217;d come to treat as a lot of money, but as a reality check is actually only about $25 AUD, but Nsit seemed very happy with it.</p>

<p>After resting in my room for a while I went for a walk down the beach, and on to the night market again. I stopped in at the pharmacy and bought more doxycylin (my anti-malaria stuff for while I&#8217;m in asia), which cost only $3 AUD for 100 capsules, compared to $14 aud for 30 back home, no prescription required.</p>

<p>At the night market I had a delicious durian milkshake and then ate a mantis shrimp (to try and absorb it&#8217;s <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp">awesome powers</a>) and a sea urchin for dinner. Both were really tasty!</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/ca291f0be91f13788bb35f2ef8ef3ba7/tumblr_inline_mnm3fkDI3A1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><em>Not as pretty as in the comic :/</em></p></p>

<p>Each night on the walk I&#8217;d had a very smiliey man in a chef hat try and get me to eat in his restaurant, laughing in a friendly manner and telling me how much he loved Australians. I felt a little bad for him since most people (and myself) keep walking on to the night markets, but I was still a little hungry on the way home so I stopped in for some more shrimp BBQed with garlic and chilli which were amazing. All the food here is so great. While waiting for the food to come I met some older Aussie travellers, probably about my parents age, and we chatted for a bit.</p>

<p>After I ate I was pretty tired so I came home and slept.</p>

<p>On the last day I decided to have a lazy day and give myself some time to actually write up these blog posts. I sat for about and hour and a half at a vietnamese coffee bar, observing how the locals drink their ice coffee very slowly so the ice melts and the flavour becomes a bit diluted; and generally lazed about enjoying the cool shade. I spent some time better organising my bag so that less frequently used stuff doesn&#8217;t need to be unpacked all the time, and even went for a run along the beach right to the end. The perfect way to end my time in Vietnam.</p>
