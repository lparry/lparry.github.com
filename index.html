  <h1><a href="/2013/12/20/istanbul-turkey">Istanbul, Turkey</a></h1>
  <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Posted on 20 December 2013</p>
  <br>
  <p>After flying into Istanbul Attaturk airport we spent the morning hiding out at
the airport in the air conditioning and waiting for the time we&#8217;d agree to meet
at our apartment with our AirBNB host. We got a taxi from the airport and my
first impressions of Istanbul proper were that everything appeared so clean,
modern and organised. The highways were multi-lane, there was nobody wandering
out trying to sell things to passing traffic, traffic flowed very quickly and
efficiently, people drove on the correct side of the road and actually stayed in
their lanes for the most part. It&#8217;s amazing how much your direct prior
experiences can colour your perceptions of a place, the Turkey we were seeing
was at odds to the reputation that the place generally has for it&#8217;s drivers.</p>

<p>The apartment we stayed in was located very close to Taksim Square, consisting
of the whole top floor of the building and a rooftop courtyard and a fantastic
view of the Bosporus. Having modern conveniences like a fridge, a washing
machine and air conditioning felt very luxurious after having just spent 5 weeks
camping in tents.</p>

  <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Posted on 06 December 2013</p>
  <br>
  <p>Breaking chronology for a change because I love these photos so much.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of old abandoned things in Berlin; there are entire sites dedicated to what&#8217;s out there, how to get in, what are the risks, etc. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated seeing old places that would have been someone&#8217;s home or workplace for years on end, but one day left to rot and let nature start reclaiming. I love seeing photos of such places, and the few abandoned places I have been very cool experiences.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/11224500606/" title="Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7392/11224500606_cf5f0ec5de_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Swan boat on the grass with the ferris wheel in the distance</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>One of the places in Berlin that really sounded unique was an old theme park, the Spreepark, which existed way back in the days of East German, becoming more westernised after the reunification of Germany. It was abandoned in 2001 and has since become thoroughly derelict. I read that you can get in to the site through gaps in the fence, but there are often security you have to watch out for, possibly with dogs, so when I found out that they&#8217;d started doing tours of the place on Sundays I decided to take the easy way out and pay to get in there legitimately.</p>

  <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Posted on 25 November 2013</p>
  <br>
  <p>As we approached Rwanda, the terrain started getting a lot more hilly than that of Uganda. We got to the border and queued up to hand in our passports and get our visa, all the while with locals trying to cut in line. I got given some minor grief over not having printed out the acceptance letter for my visa. I did have it in digital form and the letter has a giant bar code that one would assume they’d scan, but apparently it’s easier to put bar codes on letters than it is to put bar code scanners at the border.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10914653853/" title="Welcome to the republic of Rwanda by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7305/10914653853_b847da95c6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Welcome to the republic of Rwanda" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Welcome to the republic of Rwanda</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>This was our single slowest border crossing, taking over 90 minutes to get some simple ink stamp &#8220;visas&#8221; put in our passports. Most of the truck was starving by the time we finally got our passports back, but there was still more driving to do before we arrived in Ruhengeri and stopped to make lunch. We were staying in dorm rooms so nobody had to put up tents for a change!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to put into words what it&#8217;s like out on the streets of Africa. They&#8217;re like no other place I&#8217;ve been. Towards the end of the trip I started taking a LOT of photos out the window in the hope it might capture even just a small fraction of the weird and wonderful things you see out the truck window. Click the photo to go to the full flickr set. Feel free to be distracted, and not notice that I haven&#8217;t posted about gorillas yet too :P</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/11/02/uganda">Uganda</a></h1>
  <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Posted on 02 November 2013</p>
  <br>
  <p>After crossing into Uganda our first stop was Jinja, the second largest city in Uganda and its unofficial extreme sports capital. We had a free day here to do whatever activities took our fancy; some people went and played mini-golf, some went and played regular golf, but I opted for white water rafting down the White Nile.</p>

<p>All up there was seven people from our Dragoman group who went along, who with our American guide Tyler made up a full raft of people. We got taken to the &#8220;put in&#8221; point where we were given some breakfast, sorted out with high-flotation life vests and paddles and then were led down to our raft for some basic training, which involved things like paddling in time, turning, getting down low in the raft, flipping the raft and climbing back in. It was all pretty straightforward stuff and the water was a lovely refreshing temperature. A lot of people struggled to get back into the raft unassisted, but I surprised myself by being one of the ones who could! I can&#8217;t even do a single chin up, but I guess climbing back into a raft probably uses a lot of the same muscles that I built up last year being stuck on crutches for nearly 6 months.</p>

<p class="flickr-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10421378166/" title="Our rafting group by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/10421378166_c1c6dd755d_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Our rafting group" class="img-responsive"><br><em>Our rafting group</em></a></p>
</p>

<p>The first rapid of the day was one of the most fun and memorable ones, it was basically a three metre waterfall drop off, followed closely by two more pools of rapids. We went down the waterfall, which felt like a theme park flume log ride on steroids, then paddled as hard as we could for the bigger pool of rapids but the current was too strong and we ended up going down the less turbulent path.</p>
