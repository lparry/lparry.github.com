    <div class="post_body">
      <p>So after leaving Tanzania we were destined for Kenya to visit the Masai Mara, however we ran into a bit of trouble actually getting into Kenya. Everyone&#8217;s visa got sorted out nice and quickly, but there was some sort of hold up involving the truck. Something to do with the truck&#8217;s registration being changed over from English to Namibian and us not having the right <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnet_de_Passages">Carnet de Passage</a> to go with it.</p>

<p>To make better use of the time we set up the kitchen to make lunch there at the border, then after eating some of the group started having a game of cricket! The spectacle drew a small crowd of truck drivers watching, and trying to catch the long shots that went their way.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124599493/" title="Cricket game at the Kenyan border by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5530/10124599493_a523f7caf6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Cricket game at the Kenyan border"></a><br>
<em>Border cricket</em></p>


<p>After a while Steve filled us in on things, apparently the registration was changed over a long time ago and the truck had been in and out of Kenya a bunch of times since then, but in the book they had always written down the old registration details, but because the border officials are so damn ethical they couldn&#8217;t do that again for us this time.</p>

<p>There were three options that Steve thought might get us out of our pickle:</p>

<ol>
<li>We leave the truck and sort out other transport to Nairobi, and then hope the Carnet gets sorted out while we&#8217;re in the Masai Mara (using smaller safari Land Cruisers again).</li>
<li>We pay a bond for the value of the truck, but apparently bond in Kenya don&#8217;t work like real bonds; it&#8217;s basically sunk money that you will never get back. Luckily the truck is on the books as being only worth $4k, instead of the probably 100K+ it would truly be worth. Still not a great option, we would need to dip into the kitty to cover it.</li>
<li>We pay a bribe to get them to make the entry in the book with the old registration, like every other time.</li>
</ol>


<p>Eventually  after about 2 hours, we were able to pay a bribe of a few hundred dollars to get the paperwork fudged by that same very ethical and totally not corrupt border official. The bribe actually had to be negotiated by our Kenyan cook Charles, because the border officials were scared of dealing with Steve,  a white guy who can look mighty pissed off when he&#8217;s not happy, and he really wasn&#8217;t happy.</p>

<p>And so, from the very start we were exposed to the best of Kenyan corruption, and it wouldn&#8217;t be our last bribe in Kenyan either!</p>

<em>Kenya is proudly sponsored by hand painted Coca Cola signs</em></p>


<p>The traffic coming into Nairobi was super congested; it took us hours to go what was probably only 20 kms. So slow in fact, and with nowhere to stop the truck, that someone on board could hold it no longer and needed to pee in a bucket! Fun times!</p>

<p>We stopped at Galleria shopping center to shop for supplies and buy some dinner in. My first impression of the Kenya based on this mall was that it&#8217;s a lot like South Africa. Everything seemed clean and modern, and generally much more developed than anywhere we went in Tanzania. It turned out however that a shopping mall is not very representative of a country; who would have thought it?!</p>

<p>The next morning we again left the truck behind and split up into safari 4WDs, this time with our whole Melbourne crew &#8220;Team Toto&#8221; in the same vehicle! Things were actually pretty disorganised, our driver didn&#8217;t even know he was driving that day so he showed up quite late and had to stop to meet his wife along the way to get some clothes for the trip.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124579975/" title="We care for your fillings by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2876/10124579975_c374892245_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="We care for your fillings"></a><br>
<em>We care for your fillings, but not enough to actually have diesel</em></p>


<p>After a few hours drive we stopped in a small town near the Masai Mara to fuel up with diesel, expect every single service station in town was bone dry. We were actually pretty lucky in that we only waited for 2 hours for one of the stations to get refueled; Apparently the car at the front of the line had been waiting 2 days for fuel!</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124551684/" title="Queues to get diesel by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5522/10124551684_85b489193a_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="Queues to get diesel"></a><br>
<em>The line of cars waiting for the pumps to be refilled</em></p>


<p>The road leading into the Masai Mara was a very poorly maintained dirt road, bumpy to the point where it just felt like we were driving over huge corrugations. That certainly didn&#8217;t mean we had to drive along it slowly though, all the Land Cruisers flew along it at 90-100 km/h and feeling like we going to fly off the road at any moment. It probably didn&#8217;t help that our Land Cruiser was 30 years old and felt like the suspension was all the original parts that came fitted on the car when it rolled off the lot. :P</p>

<p>At one point we slowed down to a stop, our driver spoke with another driver for a bit and then let us know that the brakes had failed. Excellent! We went to continue anyway but then the car wouldn&#8217;t start and we needed a push to get going again, thankfully a whole lot slower now that we weren&#8217;t able to stop ourselves.</p>

<p>We drove to the park gate where they sorted out a replacement vehicle for us to go off in that afternoon while they got our one fixed up, so we didn&#8217;t entirely miss our afternoon game drive.</p>

<p>Now if your thinking, &#8220;Gee, that sounds like a pretty shitty day&#8221; you&#8217;d be right at this point. So many things had gone wrong up till now that I felt like I would have been happy to just go to camp and forget the game drive, but I&#8217;m incredibly glad we ended up going because those 1-2 hours in the park that afternoon completely salvaged an otherwise terrible day and left us in great spirits for the evening!</p>

<p>We drove straight in to where a lot of cars were following a leopard that was walking around near some bushland. It felt a bit like a circus with so many cars circled around with so little respect for the animals personal space. Where in the Serengeti the drivers stick to the roads and you get to see what you can see from there, in the Masai Mara it&#8217;s a free for all and they drive you right up to things, and the moment the animal moves so so all the vehicles in order to stay right up close. We pulled up probably only 2-3 meters away from the leopard, which honestly felt like we were getting way too close, but it made for some fantastic photos. It did mean that when the leopard glared in our direction, it really felt like it could just jump in the vehicle and kill the lot of us if it chose to.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124707306/" title="…and then we got up way way closer by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/10124707306_10ffa35a4d_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="…and then we got up way way closer"></a><br>
<em>Leopard, not so happy to see us</em></p>


<p>After the leopard got fed up with the circus and went into hiding we raced off and very briefly saw a cheetah sitting in too long a grass to really see much, so then we shot off again to see 2 lionesses &amp; 6 cubs playing. Again we got right up close, front row seats, and turned the engines off. Up that close in near silence it was possible to forget the media circus that you were part of and really just enjoy watching the lion cubs play. It was beautiful!</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124891973/" title="Daaaaw by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/10124891973_e3d21f0b50_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Daaaaw"></a><br>
<em>So cute!</em></p>


<p>After about 15 minutes, all of the circus suddenly started their engines and we all raced away back to the road. Our driver told us that they&#8217;d heard that park rangers were on there way over and we wanted to get away without getting a &#8220;big fine&#8221; of 10,000 Kenyan Shillings, or about USD$120.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124756964/" title="Lion cubs playing by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7303/10124756964_3a689d5a17_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Lion cubs playing"></a><br>
<em>The family portrait</em></p>


<p>The penalties for venturing off the roads are significantly lower in Kenya compared to Tanzania. In Tanzania the drivers would loose their licence as well as get a large fine, and hence be unable to work anymore, so in Tanzania everyone stays on the road. But in Kenya there&#8217;s only the monetary penalty which they just pass on to the customers anyway, which is why they&#8217;re willing to break the rules and go way off-road in the Masai Mara.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124824455/" title="Lion cubs by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7390/10124824455_ef91488097_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lion cubs"></a><br>
<em>Baby cubs!</em></p>


<p>I&#8217;m in two minds about the whole thing. On one hand it made the place feel a lot more zoo like, or that we were all just a part of some horrible media paparazzi, and if our driver had stayed back on the road it would only really be disadvantaging ourselves because no-one else was and they&#8217;d all get in the way of us seeing anything at all. But on the other hand it felt incredibly special getting up so close the animals, and as Steve pointed out, it&#8217;s been like this for so long that the animals have never known it any differently so they&#8217;re not at all phased by the cars.</p>

<p>Back at the campsite we happily drank some beers and recounted all the cool stuff we&#8217;d seen that afternoon and you would never have even known that it was the same day where all that stuff went wrong! The campsite had permanent tents for us to stay in so we didn&#8217;t even have to set up tents that night, a huge luxury for us!</p>

<p>The next morning we were up early to get in the gate as soon as the park opened, on a hunt to find more big cats and the shining sun made for a great day for just that. From a long way away we spotted a lioness trying to hunt a bird and failing miserably, but it was actually really close to where the lions were the day before, so we headed over to investigate.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124907475/" title="Big male lion by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7451/10124907475_6eab63bbb4_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Big male lion"></a><br>
<em>Big male lion</em></p>


<p>Once we were closer we found a big male lion just sitting, being all majestic in the sun, and over behind him there were 2 lionesses eating and occasionally fighting over some sort of animal carcass.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124854754/" title="Fighting over food by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7333/10124854754_6fcd11147b_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Fighting over food"></a><br>
<em>Lionesses fighting over food</em></p>


<p>All of a sudden the females stopped what they were doing and stared in our direction. I was thinking, &#8220;Shit, what have we done? They look mean and are probably going to eat us now&#8221; but it turned out they were looking past us. A long way past us in fact, where probably 1000 meters away there was a large herd of wildebeests. At first none of us thought they could actually be what they had stopped so suddenly over, but then one lioness and the lion set off down a gully that separated us from the herd and then reappeared on the other side and continued towards them.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10124989066/" title="and then suddenly: DEATH STARE by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/10124989066_37500dc7ce_c.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="and then suddenly: DEATH STARE"></a><br>
<em>Wildebeest herd spotted</em></p>


<p>We sped off the long way around the gully and then follow the two lions as they chased the heard and split it in two, then changed targets and chased after a different herd several more times, but never actually making an attack while we were watching.</p>

<em>Wildebeests fleeing</em></p>


<p>We gave up on seeing those two hunt and ventured back to see what the others were doing, and we find 2 other lionesses with the cubs with at least 2 dying wildebeests in the large grassy plain, both still occasionally kicking.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125168873/" title="Finishing off a wildebeest by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5457/10125168873_0267f56587_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Finishing off a wildebeest"></a><br>
<em>Finishing off a wildebeest</em></p>


<p>The lions were all focused on one wildebeest, and the circus of cars circled around to watch the lions and sort of gave the other wildebeest some cover. After several attempts it somehow managed to get back on its feet and tried to make a break for it, but somehow even through all the vehicles the lions spotted it and chased it down again to kill it. Sadly we missed the crucial moment because other cars pull in and obscured our view, but we did get to see the very end of the predation with the lion going for the wildebeest&#8217;s neck.</p>

<em>Realising the other wildebeest has gotten back up</em></p>


<p>We drove a long way further into the park, well away from the thick swaths of vans that you don&#8217;t seem to be able to get away from near the main gate and saw plenty of cool small stuff and big stuff. An baby giraffe and it&#8217;s mum, hippos lazing in the river while crocodiles slept on the bank.</p>

<em>Mother and baby giraffe</em></p>


<p>It seemed like we had probably seen all the big cats we were going to see that day, as they normally like to laze around in the sun in the warm afternoons, but today we got luck and saw even more cats in the afternoon!</p>

<p>We noticed a lone car quite a long way from the road and went over to investigate and were pleasantly surprised to find four cheetah on sitting around a rock, and as we pulled up the other car left and it was just us and the cheetahs! It was marvelous, but being the only car there made our driver nervous (much more likely to be fined when you&#8217;re breaking the rules by yourself I guess) so we only stayed for a few minutes.</p>

<em>Cheetahs chilling</em></p>


<p>We went back to see what another car from out group was looking at and arrived just as another pair of cheetahs disappeared into the long grass! Our drivers had a discussion and we turned around to take the other car back to see our four cheetahs, and boy am I glad we did!</p>

<em>Cheetah close up</em></p>


<p>When we got back there they had moved a bit further on and looked to be staring quite intently at something in the distance. We spotted a lone warthog and got excited that we might get to see some hunting, and sure enough two or three of the cheetahs started running towards it. But to our surprise, suddenly a whole lot of grass started to rustle and we could suddenly see  there was a whole pack of warthogs that were suddenly running for their lives!</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125304546/" title="Cheetahs! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7347/10125304546_a6e69a6038_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Cheetahs!"></a><br>
<em>Cheetah hunting</em></p>


<p>The cheetahs managed to split one off from the pack and we were sure one of them chasing a lone warthog was going to get it, but in a split second the warthog went into long grass and the next thing we saw was like a Benny Hill movie and they were not running in the opposite direction with the warthog chasing the cheetah! I guess he must have remembered that he had bad ass big tusks and could just as easily gut the cheetah as it could chase him down. And so both the warthog and the cheetah both lived to see another day.</p>

<p>On top of the cheetahs, Leigh managed to spot a lion sleeping by the waterhole, as in actually spotted the animal itself as there were no other vehicles around it. It was certainly waaaaaay nicer on these occasions where it felt like it was just us the and animals as opposed to the circus that went on elsewhere</p>

<p>On our last morning we were up early again for another sunrise game drive, and within about 10 minutes of entering the park we came across an absolutely huge herd of elephants. There must have been at least 40 of them roaming around together. Magical!</p>

<p>After some more driving around we found two bloody mouthed lions eating something they had killed with two small cubs, but they were in quite long grass with a paparazzi of people around them and we&#8217;d seen such awesome lions the day before we ventured on in hope of seeing something better.</p>

<p>We spent most of the morning in search of Rhinos to complete the big five, but unfortunately even after hours of driving we didn&#8217;t seem much beyond the few random carcasses on the side of the road and a few jackal.</p>

<em>A bird. An ugly bird.</em></p>


<p>The morning ended with a bit of a kufufle between Steve and the drivers about the game drive ending earlier than it was supposed to, and our driver not putting in the time to go look for some wild dogs one of the other vehicles had spotted. It was a real shame to mar what had been a pretty amazing few days in the Masai Mara by ending this way, but  I guess these things happen.</p>

<p>The drive back out to the bitumen road felt even longer and bumpier and bumpier than the way in and there was a cheer in the car when we were finally back on sealed roads, and could start making better time for the long drive back to Nairobi.</p>

<p>That day marked the end of that leg of the tour, and hence the start of the next leg: The gorilla loop! We were sad to lose some of our truck buddies and our fantastic cook Charles, but there were new people waiting to join us back at camp and our new cook Mash who turned out to be just as much of a wizard in the camp kitchen as Charles was. It was mind blowing the quality of the meals prepared in a kitchen that got setup and packed down into a few plastic tubs every day, and for 25 people each meal too. I have to hand it to Dragoman, they pick their crew very well!</p>

<p>Some of us went out for dinner at Carnivore, a quite famous restaurant in Nairobi that gained it&#8217;s fame by running an all you can eat grill with all sorts of exotic game meat. The place felt like some sort of movie world-like theme park, with the waiters dressed in very flarey garb and the adjoined night club cranking out loud music, it was very surreal to be at a place that felt like it would fit in well in Hollywood, but to know you were actually in Kenya.</p>

<p>Unfortunately none of us had done our research very well, and so didn&#8217;t know that Kenya had banned the sale of game meat quite a few years ago, and that the most exotic meats on the menu these days were ostrich and crocodile. They also served lamb, beef, chicken and pork, and a few out of the ordinary offal meats such as ox testicles and chicken liver. For those wondering ox testicles have a very soft, melt in your mouth texture and don&#8217;t taste half bad!</p>

<p>It was a nice night, a very memorable experience, and the meats we got to eat were generally all very tasty, but had I known I wasn&#8217;t going to get to eat wildebeest and zebra I probably would have gone somewhere else.</p>

<p>The next morning we stopped again at the Galleria shops for supplies, where I spent the entirety of my free time dealing with ATM shenanigans, trying to get enough shillings to buy the USD I needed to pay for my trip kitty for this leg of the tour. Every single Automatic ATM Machine (trollololol) in the centre was completely empty, right up until about 10 minutes before we were supposed to meet up after I watched the very long process of filling the ATMs by hand from a big sack of cash.</p>

<p>I stayed there and maxed out my limit, before rushing back to the truck hoping I wouldn&#8217;t be the last person back that everyone was waiting on. I got lucky and we had some extra time because the driver of the cab that Leigh left his phone in the night before was coming to drop it off. I managed to get to a bank and get it changed to USD and was finally able to pay the remaining part of my trip kitty. Such a huge relief after weeks of screwing about trying to obtain it!</p>

<p>Our next stop was Lake Nakuru, where it was raining quite heavily and the campsite had turned to mud. The truck got well bogged as well pulled in and we needed to get a giant tractor to get it pulled out. We took the easy way out that night and 6 of us upgraded to one of the bungalows instead of dealing with tents that night. Apparently it&#8217;s the rainy season here, which was a shock to us since we were still in the southern hemisphere (ie. Technically winter, although not really cold) and I think most of use though it was going to be dry season everywhere we were going.</p>

<em>Big tractor towing the truck out</em></p>


<p>We went on another early morning game drive around Lake Nakuru and quickly saw that the heavy rain was not a one-off thing. The lake has been flooding for a long time now and it&#8217;s banks are well broken, apparently there&#8217;s nowhere for the water to drain so it just continues to expand, even blocking of the main entrance into the park. There was quite a large forest near the waters edge that was so waterlogged that most of the trees had just plain fallen over, roots and all, and nearly all the flamingos that the lake is famous for are gone because the algae they come to eat is too deep for them to get to now.</p>

<p>We saw a heap of black rhinos, they seemed to be everywhere, which completed the big five for everyone who hadn&#8217;t already done so.</p>

<p>We saw some giraffes play fighting, bashing their necks but quite slowly and gently compared to when they&#8217;re out for blood.</p>

<p>We found a lion sleeping on a rock.</p>

<p>But the most memorable part of the morning was the epic bogging that occurred when we tried to pass a large puddle in the road. The first van of our went through  to one side and got stuck. We waited a while and someone came along and gave them a tow out.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10125389144/" title="Van one gets bogged by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5331/10125389144_50cb9c6a03_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Van one gets bogged"></a><br>

<p>The second van in our convoy went in, the exact same path as the first, and predictably got bogged too.</p>

<em>Then van two gets bogged</em></p>


<p>After the drivers had gotten out and wondered how they were going to get the van out, our driver got bored waiting and tried to pass the other side of the puddle. We sped in with the engine redlining, and after a few very aggressive bumps we were out the other side with cheers all round.</p>

<p>Eventually a 4WD by and towed our other van out, so we were all finally past the obstacle, but then the 4WD itself tried to go through the puddle straight through the middle, where unbeknownst to us there was a very, very deep hole, and so it got completely stuck with one wheel floating up in the air. We all got out and sticky-beaked for a while, but since there was nothing we could do to help we went on to finish out game drive.</p>

<p>After Nakuru we made our way to the Ugandan border, uneventfully crossing the equator by land for the first time with little perceivable change in the weather even though it was now technically summer :P The border crossing into Uganda was much smoother than the on into Kenya, we paid our money, got our stamps and in we went!</p>

    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/10/01/tanzania-part-2">Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>So the main draw card for visiting Tanzania was in fact not to go and laze about Zanzibar, rather it was to go and visit the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, some of Africa&#8217;s best known big game parks.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10000707374/" title="Serengeti official gate by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2831/10000707374_6b3b8cb833_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Serengeti official gate"></a><br>
<em>The Serengeti</em></p>


<p>We left our overland truck behind and divided off into a number of safari Landrovers with just enough clothing and food for the few days we&#8217;d be in the parks.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10001160445/" title="Safari trucks by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5447/10001160445_64e82f1512_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Safari trucks"></a><br>
<em>Our safari Land Rovers that you can pop the tops on!</em></p>


<p>To get into the Serengeti we needed to drive up over the rim of the crater (but not into the crater), past where we would be camping the following night. As we drove up the temperature dropped quite noticeably, and at the top we stopped at a lookout point where there was a pretty spectacular view of the crater. We then descended down another side of the crater and into the Serengeti.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10000698293/" title="Ngorongoro Crater lookout by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/10000698293_a3676eda09_c.jpg" width="800" height="247" alt="Ngorongoro Crater lookout"></a><br>
<em>The Horizon is not actual this wonky in real life.</em></p>


<p>It had been very dry for quite some time apparently, which meant that vehicles going in and out kicked up heaps and heaps of dusk. A lot of the dirt roads leading up to the Serengeti park entrance was a very rich red, which made some beautiful vistas where you&#8217;d have a very pale green and yellow hill with a dark red line cut through it, with an almost painted looking red gradient fading down wind of the road for 10-15M and a few meters upwind of it. It&#8217;s hard to really describe it well with words, so here&#8217;s a photo!</p>

<em>Red dirt roads cut through the landscape</em></p>


<p>Anyhow, on our first day in the Serengeti we saw a ton of stuff. Not long after we got into the main part of the park we passed 4-5 lions sleeping, which had surprisingly few other vehicles stopped around them. In these parks you often seem to find the big 5 by just looking for the clusters of 4WDs.</p>

<em>Lions chilling</em></p>


<p>That is actually how we found two leopards sleeping in trees, so far from the road you couldn&#8217;t see them with the naked eye. All the stopped vehicles got us to stop and try and work out what they were looking at, and then through binoculars you could make them out lying in the forks of trees and see their tail hanging down.</p>

<em>Might need to click through to the high res version on Flickr to actually see him</em></p>


<p>Of course we saw a whole lot of the more common stuff too. We had a small herd of elephants that were approaching the road and walked right passed our Land Rover less than a few meters away. There were several hyenas roaming about, heaps and heaps of Grant&#8217;s and Thompson&#8217;s gazelles, a few heart beasts, and a lot of lovably ugly warthogs.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10002412986/" title="They're coming right for us! by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5539/10002412986_65e2c908fe_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="They're coming right for us!"></a><br>
<em>Elephants, coming right for us!</em></p>


<p>That night we actually camped in the Serengeti. They do have dedicated camp areas there, but don&#8217;t get the wrong impression. There are no fences and you really are camping out in the wild. We were instructed to set up out tents with a few meters gap between them, just in case elephants or hippos came through so that they&#8217;d have enough room to pass rather than just walking straight over tents; and not long before bed several people saw a hyena shaped silhouette with lit up eyes from the torchlight. Sadly, being a heavy sleeper, I slept through any animal sounds that may or may not have been made that night.</p>

<p>We were instructed that if we woke up in the middle of the night and heard noises, to just stay in out tents and be quiet, and don&#8217;t turn on any lights. If you need to go to the toilet, hold it. If you cant hold it, wake up your tent buddy, shine a torch outside the tent looking for eyes, then go right there next to the tent while your buddy keeps watch and deal with it in the morning. I was glad to be someone who very rarely needs to get up in the middle of the night!</p>

<p>We were up well before sunrise the next day for one of the major trip highlights, hot air ballooning over the Serengeti! We were collected in 4WDs and driven to the site where they where getting things set up. It was interesting to see how they inflate the balloons with huge fans to start off with the basket on it&#8217;s side. They then squeeze everyone into their compartments while it&#8217;s still on it&#8217;s side and you feel a bit like an astronaut about to blast off to the moon, lying flat to the ground looking up towards the moon in the still dark sky.</p>

<em>A balloon being fan inflated</em></p>


<p>The burners begin getting fired and the balloon slowly rises, eventually tipping the basket upright. The actual take-off was so gentle you don&#8217;t even feel the balloon lift off, just all of a sudden you&#8217;re no longer on the ground and moving. It&#8217;s very surreal very surreal.</p>

<em>Like spacemen about to take off</em></p>


<p>Each balloon held 16 passengers and a pilot, and there were three balloons going up that morning. Our group was 15 people and we ended up getting a balloon to ourselve!</p>

<p>During the balloon flight we saw our first hippos of the Serengeti, probably 20-30 of them concentrated in the water and dashing about nearby. From the roads the park feels like a completely flat and dry, yellow savannah; but from the air you see the gashes of green carved through the yellow where the waterways runs through, and there&#8217;s actually quite a lot of animal activity in and around these parts.</p>

We got to see the sun rise from the air, after which the balloon started casting a nice shadow silhouette on the ground.

</p>


<p>As we flew further over the park we passed over a few lioness&#8217; and one very majestic male lion with a huge big mane who just sort of looked up at us, wondering what the heck we were I guess. I stupidly had my camera recording video so here&#8217;s a photo a friend took:</p>

<p>Most of the animals didn&#8217;t seem to pay us much attention although we did manage to startle some buffalo when we were flying quite low, firing the burners caused them to look up suddenly and then dash off a short distance before realising we weren&#8217;t a threat. At one point we were gliding so low that the basket actually skimmed over the top of an Acacia.</p>

<p>Just as we were landing we spotted a hyena chasing down a gazelle. Everyone was pretty disappointed to be told we had to get back into the take off position for safety, where we were unable to keep watching. The landing was very smooth; not quite as unnoticeable as the take off, but still hardly a bump or drag along the ground and we were stopped on the ground, upright and everything. Our pilot had mad skills!</p>

<em>Obviously not actually the balloon I was in</em></p>


<p>Upon landing we had a Champagne breakfast and were told the entertaining story about French ballooning pioneers, which rather than reinterpret I&#8217;ll quote here:</p>

<p class="excerpt">The creation of the hot air balloon dates back to the 1700s, and the first flight occurred on Oct. 19, 1783 in France.</p>




<p class="excerpt">In 18th century France, there were educated people living in the city and there were landowners and peasants in the country. People in the rural areas often had little contact and connection to what was going on in the city.</p>




<p class="excerpt">So, picture this, you are a peasant working in the fields and all of the sudden you see this balloon floating through the air with fire coming out of it. Is it an alien? An attacker? For peasants who hadn’t heard of hot air ballooning,  the sight of a balloon falling from the sky surprised and often frightened them; especially when they saw the pilot’s face covered in black from ash and soot from the fire keeping the balloon aloft.</p>




<p class="excerpt">To avoid being attacked by the people they surprised, hot air balloon pilots carried Champagne or wine with them as a way to let onlookers know they were human and to thank them for the safe landing in their field.</p>


<p>So there you have it, Champagne is the way to settle down rowdy French farmers when you&#8217;re trespassing on their property!</p>

<em>Champagne, breakfast of champions!</em></p>


<p>The breakfast was very fancy, even by western standards. As we approached the tables there was a guy with a basin and a jug of warm water who&#8217;d pour it so you could wash your hands, and them dry them with a real cotton towel! The table settings wouldn&#8217;t have been at all out of place in a fancy restaurant, and as we got closer I could smell my old friend bacon, sizzling away somewhere.</p>

<p>Having not had bacon since leaving home, I would have been happy if they&#8217;d served me just a plate of bacon, but there were eggs, sausages, fruit, coffee and juice&#8230; It was like a real English breakfast and then some!</p>

<p>To make the day even better, when we got back to camp Charles had make us pancakes and bacon for brunch! Could a day be any more perfect!?!</p>

<p>After brunch we got back in the Land Rovers for an afternoon of game driving with a general meander towards the gate of the park, during which we managed to spot a log more awesome animals. We found 3 lion cubs sleeping in a crevice between some rocks, then a bit later we found a cheetah, and a bit later still two more cheetahs!</p>

<em>Daaaaaw!</em></p>


<p>We also saw a lion that was standing up in long grass looking around, who then sat down and completely disappeared, making it very clear how hard it could be to spot these animals if they were trying to hide.</p>

<p>The drive out seemed like it was 10x as dusty as the drive in; even with large gaps between our vehicles and us rapidly closing our windows every time we passed another car, everything in the Land Rovers was covered in a thick coating of dust by the time we got out of the park.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014838763/" title="It was dusty by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/10014838763_7f2f1d9f38_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="It was dusty"></a><br>
<em>It was super dusty</em></p>


<p>We headed back up to the crater rim to Simba Camp where we were staying the night. It was freezing cold that night and although there were showers with a hot tap, the water that came out was barely room temperature and even that quickly ran out leaving only icy water for those who wanted relief from the dust.</p>

<p>It was so cold that night that I wore pretty much every layer I had plus my Goretex wind shell, and still wasn&#8217;t particularly warm. I headed to bed pretty much straight after dinner and was thankful that our thick canvas tents held heat so well.</p>

<p>Simba camp was another unfenced camp ground, but again if there were animal sounds I managed to sleep right through them. We got up before dark and packed down camp in order to get to the Ngorongoro Crater park gates for opening, with a light drizzle of rain coming down on us.</p>

<p>As we descended into the crater the temperature rose very slightly, but the weather in that crater is completely different to that only a few KM outside of it and it remained pretty grey and cold all day.</p>

<em>Light rays cutting through the grey</em></p>


<p>Not long after passing the gate someone in out truck spotted some ears in the grass. We backed up to have a better look and found a small cat called a caracal. Were told they themselves aren&#8217;t rare, but it&#8217;s quite rare to see them. Steve had never seen one in all his years in Africa, and our driver who&#8217;s in and out of the park all the time hadnt seen one in 4 years.</p>

<em>The caracal</em></p>


<p>In contrast to the steep walls of the crater, the bottom of it was mostly quite flat, with lots of open plains, some forested areas and a few large watering holes.</p>

<em>Wildebeasts</em></p>


<p>We saw several elands in the forests, and hundreds of wildebeast and zebra out roaming the plains.</p>

<p>We saw a pair of birds call grey crowned cranes which our driver explained to us were married, as in they were paired for life, but if divorce statistics are to be believed that&#8217;s probably no longer a great analogy.</p>

<em>A pair of grey crowned cranes</em></p>


<p>We did manage to spot one male lion sleeping in the grass, and several females sleeping in the distance, but because the weather was cold the big cats were mostly sleeping, and sadly for us were largely well away from the road.</p>

<p>What we didn&#8217;t see in terms of big cats was largely made up for by the number of hyenas we saw around. We must have seen at least 4-5 separate individuals or groups, one of with was a full family with a number of cubs playing. Very cute for a part of &#8220;the ugly 5&#8221;!</p>

<em>Family of hyena</em></p>


<p>On the drive out of the park, back to civilisation where we were camping that night, we learnt a few tidbits about the Masai culture that partly explained how it can be normal to have multiple wives without a huge gender imbalance, or a lot of men having no wives.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10000755303/" title="Masai shepard by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/10000755303_b7bdcb497f_c.jpg" width="800" height="273" alt="Masai shepard"></a><br>
<em>Masai&#8217;s are allowed to graze their cattle in the Serengeti</em></p>


<p>The number of wives a Masai man has is directly related to how many cattle he has, so having lots of cattle means lots of wives. The interesting part we learnt about was that the non-monogamy/polyamory that goes on apparently works in both directions. A man has many wives, but if he goes to visit one and finds a spear dug in the ground outside of her house, it means she has a male guest &#8220;visiting,&#8221; and that the husband should go and find a different bed to stay in that night, we&#8217;re told all with no jealousy!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that means that a woman actually has multiple husbands, but it does offer a bit of an explanation why wifeless men aren&#8217;t rioting about there being no available women because of the greedy guys with all the cattle.</p>

<p>After we arrived at camp, and those of us camping had set up our tents, we were taken on a village tour of Mto Wa Mbu village. We took a very long walk though their farms, through large fields of beans, tomatoes, tapioca, rice, bananas, and numerous other food plants. We were shown the different materials that the people used to build their houses. The cheapest materials being mud houses, the mid-cost ones being made of red bricks, and the most expensive also being the most ugly, cement houses.</p>

<em>walking through the farms</em></p>


<p>We were taken to a local art gallery, where the locals can get taught to paint for a living, and shown the two main styles of art common in Tanzania. And boy were they common, the paintings here were 90% the same largely generic ones we&#8217;d seen from Zanzibar onwards. There was a token guy putting the finishing touches on a piece, but as always seems to be the case the piece was pretty much done and he was putting a border on it, so for all we know the paintings are mass produced in a factory and then that guy paints a border on when tourists come past. They&#8217;re all so same-y that I would not be surprised. It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;re not teaching them to utilize their creative differences instead of teaching them how to be human photocopiers.</p>

<em>Boy could that guy paint straight black lines super good</em></p>


<p>There were one or two exceptions, painting completely unique from everything else on display. One of a one zebra really struck a chord with me, but I held off the urge to buy it because I didn&#8217;t want to be stuck dragging it around with me for weeks until I got back to somewhere with a reliable postal system.</p>

<p>One detour to the normal tour itinerary was a visit to see the local nightclub. We saw the sign and were intrigued and asked about it, and they were all too happy to have us have a look inside at them cleaning and setting things up. It felt kind of like something out of rave movie from the 90s, completely with a dance pit, and raised up DJ booth, and also a cool bar made of concrete and beer bottle ends.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/10014856956/" title="Inside the nightclub by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3731/10014856956_bfdc665c15_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Inside the nightclub"></a><br>
<em>Glowing like a 90s rave party</em></p>


<p>The last point of interest on the tour was a stop at the local bar, to drink some of the locally made banana beer. It&#8217;s made with a special type of banana and sprouted millet and fermented for a few days giving it a alcohol percentage of roughly 1-2%. The flavour was actually not particularly banana-ry, but the price was dirt cheap! 1000 Tanzanian shillings for 0.5L, or roughly $0.30!</p>

<p>And that pretty much wraps up the time we spent in Tanzania. There was some fun to be had crossing the border into Kenya, but that&#8217;s material for the next post :)</p>
