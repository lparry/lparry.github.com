  <br>
  <p>So I set out on this trip aiming to travel light, with just a 46 Litre backpack and a daypack, but after nearly 4 months on the road I put up the white flag.</p>

<p>Up until I hit Africa I managed ok, but almost always had an overflow bag clipped on to make packing a bit less of a pain day to day, but I could squeeze everything in when I needed to fly.</p>

<p>Doing Africa overland demanded that I buy a sleeping bag, and air mattress, which meant I could no longer squeeze just into the two bags. I tried strapping a now quite heavy overflow bag on the back of my pack, but it just mean that weight distribution was terrible and I wasn’t carrying any less shit.</p>

  <br>
  <p>On my first morning alone in Udaipur I went for a bit of an aimless wander around, and ended up at the zoo, which with my typical travel luck, was closed that day. I had a bit of a walk around the gardens surrounding it which were very nice, and sat in the shade reading a book for a few hours.</p>

<p>I took a very round about walk back into town and stumbled across quite a long street market which was full of colour and activity, so I spent quite a while taking photos.</p>

<p>I organised a taxi up to see the monsoon palace for sunset, right up on top of the hill overlooking Udaipur. The views of the city were fantastic, but the gloomy overcast afternoon made the sunset into a non-event.</p>

  <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Posted on 26 August 2013</p>
    </a>
  <br>
  <p>The next morning half the tour group boarded a train heading to Delhi to finish up their tour, but the 4 of us staying on and Moon went and got a local bus heading to a little village called Nimaj Bagh. The place were were staying was an old palace turned into a hotel, with beautifully painted trims on all the doorways, arches and windows. The place also had a pool which we hung out in all afternoon, making the heat a whole lot more bearable.</p>

<p>We got taken on another village tour, which was quite similar to Tordi Garh, but there was a tiny bit more evidence of western influence and capitalism here, in the form of a few more general store type shops and one place selling tourist trinkets. The kids, however, were just as beautiful and innocent, wanting little more than to see themselves on the screen of our cameras.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/08/19/india-part-2">India Part 2 - Train stations parties until the little hours of the night</a></h1>
  <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Posted on 19 August 2013</p>
    </a>
  <br>
  <p>The overnight train the second time around, from Varanasi to near Agra, was a bit of an ordeal. We showed up at the station at 21:00, one hour before the train was scheduled to depart at 22:00, and were soon told that the train had been delayed a few hours, now expected at 00:00. We went into the upper class and sleeper class reserved seating area to sit and wait and found it was full of people sleeping on the benches. One of the guys checking people were allowed to be in there went around and woke some people up, clearing enough seats so everyone could at least sit down.</p>

<p>We soon noticed what appeared to be rats lurking in the shadows underneath benches, occasionally making dashes in and out of the toilets. The toilets were a sight to not be seen. Wreaking of shit, the guys toilets consisted of three squats one of which had leaking plumbing that sprayed water at you as you first walked in the door, or went near the basin to wash your hands. How lovely!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/08/13/india-part-1">India Part 1 - Immense frustration</a></h1>
  <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Posted on 13 August 2013</p>
    </a>
  <br>
  <p>I&#8217;m going to prefix this by apologising that it&#8217;s ridiculously long; I really understand that quote &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the length of this letter but I didn&#8217;t have time to write a shorter one&#8221;. I&#8217;m struggling to keep up, this will probably be the last post I write in this format, which is probably for the best.</p>

<p>I arrived in Delhi quite late at night, about 1am, and was very glad to have an airport transfer already organised. The roads of India didn&#8217;t seem too crazy at that time of night, or at least no worse than Vietnam or Cambodia; how little did I know back then. I checked into my hotel, Hotel Perfect, and went straight to bed.</p>

<p>I woke the next day and went out in search of an ATM so I could get some Rupees and some breakfast. The ATM was easy enough, although the maximum withdrawal was less than AUD $200, another win for my overseas-transaction-fee free credit card. I&#8217;d hate to be getting socked with $5-10 foreign ATM fees for every $200 I needed.</p>

<p>Breakfast wasn&#8217;t so easy to find. The area the hotel was in, Karol Barg, seemed to be mostly closed, which seemed a bit silly in a country where it gets so hot to be shut for the coolest part of the day.</p>
