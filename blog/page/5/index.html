    <div class="post_body">
      <p>So while in South Africa I managed to see the two main places people go, Johannesburg and Cape Town, which are pretty much at opposite ends of any spectrum you can imagine. Safety, things to do, how pretty the city is&#8230; Johannesburg ranks very low and Cape Town generally ranks pretty well.</p>

<p>My time in Johannesburg was pretty whirlwind-ish. I&#8217;d already decided that I didn&#8217;t really want to spend much time there and would rather get to Cape Town, but I wanted to see the Apartheid Museum and I needed to reconfirm that I was actually eligible for my Tanzanian Visa on arrival, otherwise I&#8217;d need to make the 100KM trip to Pretoria to visit their consulate.</p>

<p>The visa thing ended up being a pretty simple phone call. They urged me to apply before hand, I explained that I wasn&#8217;t in Pretoria, they confirmed that I could get it on arrival. Booyah!</p>

<p>I asked quite a few locals about safety in Johannesburg and if the whole danger thing was as big of an issue as people make out and was told I&#8217;d be fine as long as I stuck to safe areas. So none of the aimless exploring that makes travelling fun; just stick to the touristy spots and you&#8217;ll be fine&#8230; and feel like a tourist.</p>

This city is nuts"></a><br>
<em>Totes safe</em></p>


<p>I decided the most cost effective way to get to the Apartheid Museum was to get on the city site-seeing bus which stopped there, and would also let me see a few other sites. The tour gave some interesting trivia, but felt like they were really stretching for content in a lot of places where they&#8217;d point out pretty but unimportant building X, and boarded up building Y.</p>

<p class="centered"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83213379@N00/9760170266/" title="Derelict building in Johannesburg by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7307/9760170266_f676b216a9_c.jpg" width="601" height="800" alt="Derelict building in Johannesburg"></a><br>
<em>There were derelict buildings like this all over Johannesburg</em></p>


<p>The Apartheid Museum was great, and I got very lucky with my timing as they had a special exhibit about Nelson Mandela on too. For those as ignorant as I was, the South African Apartheid was a system of segregation enforced by the government, dividing up the whites, the blacks and the coloured people, not allowing the groups to mix or mingle and giving a load of preferential treatment to the whites while treating the black people like shit. Oh, and this was happening right up into the early 90s; It&#8217;s shocking to think that if I&#8217;d been born a South African I actually would have lived 1/3rd of my life under such a system. It made me wonder a lot about the white South Africans I was coming into contact with and wondering how they&#8217;d felt about the whole thing while it was privileging them. And about the black South Africans I met, and how I couldn&#8217;t fault them for being extremely bitter about the whole thing, still so fresh but being told to get over it.</p>

<em>Johannesburg is not exactly picturesque</em></p>


<p>On my other day in Joburg I undertook the cultural experience of catching one of the local minibus&#8217; to East Gate shops in search of needed camp gear for my upcoming overland tour.</p>

<p>These are basically your standard white minivan that you flag down and they&#8217;ll give you a lift where they&#8217;re going for less than $1. I was the only white guy on the minibus in both directions and it felt like having a white guy in there was a bit of a novelty. Someone from the bus actually came up and said hello to me in the shopping centre later, only adding to the feeling that white people don&#8217;t really catch the minibus&#8217; often.</p>

<p>I met a friendly American named Erin at my Johannesburg hostel, who was heading to Cape Town a day earlier than me. She sent me a message after she arrived saying how great Cape Town was and how I should definitely spend my time there instead of Joburg. So I booked my flight for early the next morning and that was that!</p>

<p>When I arrived at my Cape Town hostel and walked in the door, I was nearly right away greeted by Phoebe and Victoria from my previous tour up to Victoria Falls. What a lovely coincidence!</p>

<em>Table Mountain, not the day we climbed it though. I stupidly forgot to get that photo so here&#8217;s a cloudy one</em></p>


<p>They were just about to head up Table Mountain, so I quickly chucked my stuff in a locker and joined them to share the taxi. It was an absolutely perfect day for it, clear skys and sunny; pretty much still air. The wind up there often gets in excess of 100 Km/h and they close it down, so to have such a nice still day in the middle of winter was fantastic. The terrain was visually very interesting, and we saw some strange little animals called a rock hyrax, a strange and unexpected relative to elephants.</p>

<em>Rock Hyrax are cute little guys</em></p>


<p>That evening they had a braai at the hostel, the South African take on BBQs, which was crazy delicious. I dunno what they do to their potatos but they&#8217;re addictive, and those long boerewors sausages are great. Erin dropped around from her hostel around the corner and we hung out drinking beers for a while before I had to retire reasonably early for my shark cage diving the next morning.</p>

<p>I got picked up at 5am and hopped into a minibus which I promptly fell asleep on and woke up a few hours later when we were arriving. They gave us a full english breakfast before fitting us with life jackets and getting us onto the boat and heading out to the site. The water around Cape Town in the middle of winter is hovering around 9-10ºC, so well-worn 7mm wetsuits were given out to us, which annoyingly meant that moving your arms too much would flush in new cold water into the suit.</p>

<p>They attract the sharks to swim by the cage by chumming the water with rotting fish guts and fish oil, and then lure them closer still with a fish head on a rope that they chuck in the water buy yank out of the sharks reach as it approaches. There&#8217;s actually <a href="http://www.stopsharkcagediving.com/">a movement against this kind of shark cage diving</a>, which claims there are alternate methods of attracting them using &#8220;audio sound vibration&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know if the science checks out, but I do admit it felt &#8220;not quite right&#8221; attracting the sharks by teasing them, but it was still an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>Diving is probably the wrong word for how this actually works. They have a cage hanging off the side of the boat in which 8 people hop in, and then drop down in the cage and breath-hold to see the sharks. I was in the first group in the water and we were pretty stoked to see quite a number of 2.5-3 metre Great Whites pass by and under the cage at close range. After about 45 minutes in the freezing water, we hopped out and let 8 more people jump in for a turn.</p>

<p>There were some volunteers up on the top deck of the boat who were trying to identify the sharks to track how many unique sharks there were, and how they behaved (ie. if they were just passing by, attacking the bait, returned attempts etc). From their count, we saw 9 different Great whites that day.</p>

<p>After all the customers had a turn in the cage they let staff &amp; volunteers have a turn, and there were two extra spots so I jumped back in for another round. It turned out to be a fantastic decision on my part, as I while I was in the cage the second time a shark charged at the bait directly towards the cage and was too slow to turn after the bait was yoinked and it rammed right into the cage. Directly in front of me. It was fucking nuts, and the level of excitement in the cage was through the roof! Probably just as well it was mostly volunteers as I think some of the other people on the boat might have freaked the fuck out.</p>

<em>I didn&#8217;t take my camera, but this is pretty much exactly what I saw</em></p>


<p>Aside from the antics I witnessed from inside the cage, I was also privileged enough to see not one, but two sharks attacking seals on the surface (not sure if they got away, we didn&#8217;t see much after the initial splash) and we had a whale come up 15 Metres from the boat (with a whale watching boat following it :P).</p>

<p>On the way back to shore we went through a channel called &#8220;Shark Alley&#8221;. We didn&#8217;t see any sharks, but the rocks along the side were covered in literally 1000&#8217;s of seals! Everywhere you looked there was blubber flapping around. I can imagine it&#8217;s like a buffet for the sharks!</p>

<p>That evening I met up with Erin again for gelati, an odd choice for the middle of winter but it was her last night in Cape Town and it was a delicious choice.</p>

<p>The next day I looked at a map and decided to walk to a strip of beach I heard was nice called Camps Bay. I walked for what must have been 2-3 hours along the coast line, and while it was a nice walk I was getting tired so I gave in and got a minibus for what turned out to be the second, much hillier half of the walk. Sort of wish I&#8217;d just gotten the minibus the whole way, but it really did look like a short walk on the map. When I got there I practiced juggling and poi in the shade for a while, and then headed back by minibus to Cape Town.</p>

<em>Camp&#8217;s Bay</em></p>


<p>I also went on a tour of Langa township, one of the townships that they forced the non-whites to live in during the apartheid years. To be honest I didn&#8217;t really feel comfortable there; the whole thing was a bit voyeuristic and I really didn&#8217;t feel comfortable going into peoples homes to have a look, even when they insisted. It just felt completely different to the villages we visited in India, or even the slums; I just got the feeling that if I was one of these people I wouldn&#8217;t want people coming to look at how shitty my living circumstances were. It was pretty heart breaking to see the poverty that these people are still living in; we saw one room of a &#8220;hostel&#8221; that was probably 3M x 3M, that was the home of three separate families.</p>

<p>That afternoon I made it out to Robben island, where they kept Nelson Mandela and a lot of other political prisoners. The most interesting part out there was a talk given to us by an actual political prisoner. It was interesting to hear that amongst the prisoners they referred to the prison as &#8220;the university&#8221;, since it was full of all the people the government didn&#8217;t really want talking to one another, but the prisoners had sneaky ways of doing so anyway.</p>

<p>I met a pleasant Italian lady named Paola who was also travelling alone, and we decided to get the City Site-Seeing bus together to see some of the more distance sites of cape town. We made stops in at the botanical gardens for a walk about, at a winery for a tour and tasting, and at a bay called Houts bay, a surreal bay that feels like there&#8217;s mountains surrounding you on all sides where we saw some seals frolicking in shallow water.</p>

<p>That evening we meet some friendly Germans who&#8217;d just arrived at our hostel, Anne and Sophie, who we have a few drinks at the hotel bar and convince to come on the other line of the site-seeing bus with us the next day.</p>

<p>We stopped off for a bit of a walk through the CBD and were a bit surprised by just how quite it was, hopped back on and drove through District 6 (The mixed-race surburb that was completely demolished, but then never rebuilt because of the backlash from the international community), then stopped at table mountain which was this time sadly blanketed in clouds. Sophie and Anne were keen to go up and hope for the best, Paola wasn&#8217;t so keen, and I&#8217;d already been up, so Paola and I continued on around the loop, which turned out didn&#8217;t actually have many more noteworthy stops before getting back to the waterfront considering the distance it covered.</p>

<p>We had lunch at a nice brewery pub called Mitchell&#8217;s Brewery, with a great range of their own beers. I got a sampler &#8220;paddle&#8221; of there beers and they had a few really great ones; I wish I&#8217;d found the place sooner, instead of on my last day there.</p>

<p>After lunch I sorted my bags into a flight ready state and headed to the airport to fly to Johannesburg Airport, where I spent the night which saved me a little money and meant I didn&#8217;t need to stress about getting there crazy early in the morning for my international flight to Dar Es Salaam the next morning. I set up camp near a group of English backpackers (safety in numbers ;)); I blew up my air mattress and rolled out my sleeping bag and tried to sleep, but being an airport meant incredibly bright lighting all night (which eye-shades dealt with fine) and loud music and regular &#8220;don&#8217;t leave you bag unattended announcements&#8221; (which ear plugs failed to help much with) so I didn&#8217;t actually sleep all that much.</p>

<em>Sleeping in Airports sucks nearly as much as sleeping on buses</em></p>


<p>I noticed that one of the other English backpackers just plain refused to even try to sleep, and spent pretty much the whole night on his feet, drinking beers (that he couldn&#8217;t take through cause of liquid restrictions) and quietly reading a book. What a lout! :P</p>

<p>The next morning, or rather later that night when I gave up trying to sleep, I was able to check in quite early (like 5 hours before the flight) and get through to the air-side of the airport and do my obligatory duty free booze buying and wait for my flight to Tanzania for my next adventure.</p>

    <div class="post_body">
      <p>I changed my flight to South Africa to be a day sooner in order to get to Johannesburg in time on Monday morning to go on a week long tour up to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and back. Booking in on this tour was a bit of a spur of the moment thing, I&#8217;d only found out about it&#8217;s existence the Wednesday beforehand; I checked if I could change my flights and if there was room on the bus, then got flights moved and got myself booked in.</p>

<p>I was picked up from the &#8220;hostel&#8221; I was staying in (It was really just a guys house that he let people stay in&#8230; you cant call it a hostel and only have one bathroom &amp; toilet) at 5am. I had been told the day before where the keys were to open the front door, the front verandah cage and the massive padlock on the front gate, topped with an electric fence, and had been told to go out and unlock all the locks, then come inside and wait looking out the window for the bus to show up. At the time I&#8217;d though it must have been a terrible neighbourhood to merit all that security, but having spent more time in South Africa I&#8217;ve found that pretty much everywhere has crazy levels of security like that so I&#8217;m not so sure anymore.</p>

<p>The bus arrived on time and I was the first person to be picked up. Our guide David, an friendly guy with a goofy laugh and a missing front tooth, introduced himself and we headed off to pick up more people, two Australian sisters from Sydney, then two English guys, then two Swiss sisters and two American cousins. Quite a few pairs of relatives!</p>

<p>We drove for a while before stopping for breakfast at a large service station, where we met up with another mini-bus full of people also on the tour. I picked up some suspect biltong to snack on during the trip here, which may have been a huge mistake.</p>

<p>We drove another few hours before stopping for lunch, still in South Africa just before the Botswanan border. Just after lunch, while talking with some of the people from the other bus, I suddenly felt a bit dizzy and had to sit down. As the day went on I started to feel really bloated and got some really nasty stomach cramps; it felt like the symptoms of diarrhea except every time I went to the toilet I couldn&#8217;t do any more than a fart.</p>

<p>The day dragged on and I felt worse and worse until we finally arrived at the camp ground at Elephant Sands at nearly 22:00&#8230; 17 hours on the road. I couldnt eat more than a bread roll at dinner and wasn&#8217;t in the mood to fuck around putting up tents in the dark, so I &#8220;upgraded&#8221; to stay in a room that night. It cost way to much for a very basic room with no glass in the windows, only fly screens; but I would have paid any amount at the time because I was feeling so awful.</p>

<p>In the morning the room&#8217;s attached toilet became a wonderful investment as yesterdays bloated constipation turned into a number 7 on the bristol stool scale. The bloating and some of the cramps went away which was a welcome relief. I went to grab my bags and head over to the other people from the tour having breakfast when I suddenly needed to dash back to the toilet. Eventually I made it over to the bus, but had to make yet another trip to the bathroom before we left.</p>

<p>People say nothing compares to the thrill of bungee jumping, sky-diving and a host of other adrenaline based sports, but I don&#8217;t think any of them could really compare to the thrill of having full blown diarrhea on a long road trip. The edge of your seat excitement, wondering if you&#8217;ll make it to the next rest stop before your belly decides it&#8217;s held things in long enough&#8230; It&#8217;s a thrill that I wouldn&#8217;t wish on anyone.</p>

<p>Thankfully I made it through the 8-9 hours of driving without any accidents with pure good luck, I swallowed a shit load of Imodium but it did nothing to the consistency of the filth spraying out of my behind at each rest stop we stopped at.</p>

<p>We set up our tents in the Victoria Falls Rest Camp and then headed to the actual falls themselves for a self-guided tour. When we arrived there was a stall trying to convince us to rent rain coats but none of us did. The sound of the falls is amazing, hearing tonnes of water per second smashing down onto rocks a hundred metres below makes a thunderous roar like you can only imagine.</p>

<p>For the most part, we were fairly dry with only a bit of spray from the falls in places, but then towards the far end of the walking path the amount of water in the air shot up dramatically, cutting what we could see to very little and completely soaking us in the process. It&#8217;s a good thing that winter days in zimbabwe are actually pretty warm and pleasant!</p>

<p>We watched someone bungee jump off the bridge over the falls, the same bridge where a bungee cord snapped a little while back while an Australian lady was jumping. She survived and now the bungee jump is run by a South African company and supposedly a whole lot safer now. I had been pretty keen on doing a bridge swing, but with my stomach how it was I decided that was completely off the table now.</p>

<p>We went back to camp, with a stop in at the activities company to book in activities for the days we were there, and waited while dinner was being cooked&#8230; and waited&#8230; and waited. Apparently somebody had come and bought all the firewood, so the guides had had to buy some green wood and it wasn&#8217;t burning well so dinner wasn&#8217;t ready until after 10pm that night. Still feeling pretty awful, I went to bed before dinner was ready and only managed to eat because I got up to go the bathroom and saw it was ready.</p>

<p>The next day I went and found a chemist, armed with my little book of how to deal with various travel illnesses, and got myself some antibiotics to kill whatever was in my gut. I took a double dose as recommended by the booklet and within just a few hours stared to feel a whole lot better. The cramps disappeared entirely and my belly stopped feeling constantly bloated. Lucky for me too, as I&#8217;d booked in for a helicopter flight that morning!</p>

<p>It was the first time I&#8217;d ever been in a helicopter and I&#8217;d opted for the longer flight option that circled around over the Zambezi river as well as the falls. This turned out to be a good idea because it meant that there was only me and another girl from the tour, plus the pilot, in the helicopter, which mean that he only had to worry about putting on a good show for the one side of the helicopter. When we saw hippos, giraffes, and other wild animals, the pilot would circle around so we got a good view.</p>

<p>The view of the falls from the air was spectacular. It was incredible to see all the previous sites of the falls, a deep canyon that zig-zagged across the land, all now covered in thick vegetation with the river flowing deep below.</p>

<p>When we got back I noticed the next helicopter ride, one of the shorter flights, was packed to capacity&#8230; It looked like quite a squeeze with some very large gentlemen climbing on board.</p>

<p>All over Victoria Falls town, there are guys trying to sell you the old Zimbabwe money, a product of the hyper-inflation that led to money that was worth more as kindling than it was as money. I got myself a 50 billion dollar note and was pretty chuffed, until I found that hyper-inflation had gone way past 50 billion and the largest bill was 100 trillion. I did manage to secure myself a 100 trillion dollar bill, and also a 1 dollar bill, both with an issue date only 1 year apart!</p>

<p>That afternoon I was booked in to go and ride an elephant, visit rhinos and go on a night game drive followed by a delicious African dinner, with the company of my Australian friends Phoebe and Victoria. On the elephant ride we saw a lot of impalas right at the start, but then disappointingly little aside from birds after that.</p>

<p>The rhinos were amazing, there would have probably been 10 or so gathered around the food thingy in their sanctuary (they&#8217;re free to roam, but appear to be pretty reliant on the people looking after them and feeding them) and the cutest little baby rhino with them. The funny little squeaky sounds they make are not the sounds you&#8217;d expect from something as large as a rhino, and their little faces really look just like dinosaurs. We got to see a few confrontations between them too when one rhino would try and push its way into the food trough, and they would face each other off and charge towards one another.</p>

<p>The &#8220;night&#8221; game drive was spectacular until the sun went down. We had some spectacular scenes of elephants and giraffes with the African sun setting behind them in the first part of it, but after the sun went down it got cold very quickly, and we found practically no more animals once it was dark, even with the bright red spotlight the driver was scanning around with.</p>

<p>Dinner was a buffet with some really night African style curry and vegetables, just the sort of nutrition I was in need of after several days where I could hardly eat. I was really glad that Phoebe and Victoria were there for dinner, or it would be just been me and a family eating together. The drive back from dinner was done in one of the open safari trucks and oh boy was it cold. The cold air blowing against my head felt like it was giving me an ice cream headache.</p>

<p>The next day I crossed over into Zambia with the two English guys from the tour, Bernard and Steven. We walked to the border, and crossed over by foot (sadly no special stamp for walking border crossings), then got a taxi on the other side to Livingstone town, about 10km away. We didn&#8217;t really have much of an idea what we wanted to do in Zambia so we had the taxi driver take us on a bit of a tour around the town, pointing out old buildings, hot night clubs and bustling markets.</p>

<p>He stopped at a strip of tourist markets, where the shopkeep at every store wanted to stop you, shake you hand and say hello, and friendly-force you into there stalls for a look, &#8220;Looking is free!&#8221;. After the 10th time I had had enough and sat down with the old ladies actually crafting things. The whole routine feels hospitable on the surface, but is thickly layered in desperation and annoyance and makes me not want to even look if I&#8217;m forced to look at everything. Even back home I avoid shops, I prefer to buy shit online and not have to deal with clueless sales staff, so being made to look inside a hundred stalls selling the African equivalent of tiny stuffed koalas and kangaroos is pretty much my version of hell.</p>

<p>That said, I did look in one shop that had some very unique paintings and I even bought one. They had cutesy African animals juxtaposed with unlikely tools and equipment. For example two giraffes sharing iPod headphones, a lion doing weights holding a barbell over its head, a parachuting hippopotamus and a leopard being shot out of a cannon; just like you see in the wild. I wish I&#8217;d taken photos, but I&#8217;ve just realised I didn&#8217;t even photograph the one I bought so now I have to hope it makes it home in the post safely.</p>

<p>After a stop in for some lunch we got a taxi back to the border, and Steven and Bernard crossed over as they were going swimming with crocodiles that afternoon. I stayed in Zambia and went to view the falls from that side. The view from Zambia was completely amazeballs. It just seemed like you could see more and get closer, without the mist in the air becoming opaque and blocking the view. Not that there wasn&#8217;t a lot of water in the air, the Zambian side made the other side look positively dry. I started to worry that even with my camera in a white water rafting/diving dry bag it was going to get wet.</p>

<p>After getting thoroughly soaked I went for a walk down a different path in the national park that led to some fantastic views of the viewing bridge in front of the falls, and the boiling pot below where the Zambian white water rafting starts from.</p>

<p>I wish I&#8217;d had more time to take the walk down there to see the rapids up close but I got distracted by a tribe of baboons who came walking past that I followed and took a lot of photos of. At first I was a bit concerned being up so close, but they really didn&#8217;t seem to even notice I was there so I followed them for about an hour taking photos. At one stage I used the flash and them a mother baboon started walking directly towards me and I got worried and walked backwards, but she just kept coming after me and many others following. I think they had coincidentally just decided to move further down the path right after my flash went off because they ended up going around me and continuing on down the path.</p>

<p>I crossed back into Zimbabwe and headed back to camp for a shower, only to find that the water was not running for the 3rd day running. It seems that running water and electricity really are luxuries even in the tourist parts of Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>We went as a group that night for dinner at a place called Mama Africa and I ate a traditional Zimbabwe hot pot that was supposedly spicy beef but I couldn&#8217;t detect even a hint of spice, nor could someone else who ordered it. That&#8217;s not to say it was bad, but it definitely wasn&#8217;t the spicy meal the menu described it as.</p>

<p>The next morning we set off back to just across the Botswanan border to Chobe, a nice short drive compared to some of the previous ones. There we went on a game drive around the Chobe game lodge, a huge wildlife park teaming with wildlife. We drove along the river and saw loads of elephants and hippos heading to and from the water for a drink, and even a crocodile or two sunning themselves on the bank. Impalas frolicked, dashing about at a frantic pace leaping over ditches. Sadly the time of day meant we were driving towards the sun for almost the entire drive, and then away from a beautiful sunset; and also that all the cats were off sleeping, but it was still a great display of wildlife.</p>

<p>Botswana had running water and taking a shower after so many days was life changing.</p>

<p>The following day we did another very long drive, broken up by having to stop a few times to sanitize our shoes for foot and mouth disease at a few control points. This consisted of taking out shoes and wetting the soles of them with some sort of liquid that I was told was soda ash. This seems highly ineffective, considering we were also bringing tents with us covered in dirt and dust that did not need sanitizing.</p>

<p>We arrived at the camp ground for the night pretty late in the afternoon and we greeted by a man who looked a lot like an African version of Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean. We had another buffet dinner, followed by drinking games, followed by the local entertainment of twp of the staff getting into a fight and one of the guys taking his pants off. I&#8217;ve seen sometimes where guys fight they&#8217;ll take their shirt off, but stripping down to a shirt and underwear to fight is new to me.</p>

<p>The last day of the tour we had to get up stupidly early to get to the South African border before the churchies arrive and congest things. Apparently a lot of people in Botswana cross over into South Africa on a Sunday for church. The border crossing was trouble free, although we had to go and get something signed off after showing that we had our yellow fever shots because a few of us had been to Zambia, which slowed things down.</p>

<p>We had a nice breakfast at a town in South Africa before doing a group photo and saying out goodbyes, after which the two buses went different routes and the larger group was split. Another few hours of driving and we were back in Johannesburg and dropped off at the various hostels.</p>
