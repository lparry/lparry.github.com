    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/06/29/wake-up-calls">Wake up calls</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>On this day, one year ago today, I woke up a little bit late.</p>

<p>I rode to work in a bit of a hurry, and on my way got cut off by a car. Getting cut off by cars happens pretty much every day, but on this day I had new brakes that I was unfamiliar with, which were significantly more effective than my old ones. That combined with rushing to not be late, meant that braking hard got me up on just the front wheel and then sent me over the handlebars, landing hard enough on my knees that I got several fractures in my acetabulum (ie. my Hip socket/pelvis).</p>

<p>This moment, at five to nine in the morning on a Friday, changed my life in a number of unexpected ways. Being completely crippled and dependant on others got me seriously thinking about the things I&#8217;d like to do but had been putting off until &#8220;the right time&#8221;, many of which are dependant on being able-bodied, and I wondered a lot about how well I would recover and how those things I&#8217;d like to do might now never happen.</p>

<p>My being such a burden put extra strain on my relationship with Kelly, and I believe at least in some part contributed to it&#8217;s demise.</p>

<p>Right at the peak of things going to shit, Amanda and Miss Fish came around and cooked me dinner and tried to lift my spirits. In what was probably just an off-hand comment, trying to distract me Amanda said I should go to Africa with her and the small group that were planning on going in July 2013.</p>

<p>Having several times in the past been on trips Amanda has organised, which have all been amazing, I said I was interested without really thinking too much about the logistics of it.</p>

<p>As the days went by and I read through the trip itinerary I decided it was exactly the sort of thing I needed at that time, something to look forward to, so I called up her travel agent and got signed up without even requesting annual leave from work first.</p>

<p>When I started thinking about leave, I realised that the 5 week trip was already a week more leave than I get in a whole year, and with my usual habit of taking a day or two off around festivals and a few days to visit my parents most years it was more like 2 years worth of leave; or a whole lot of unpaid leave.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seemed like if I was paying all that money to get to Africa, it would be silly not to go and see and other nearby stuff, like visiting the pyramids and diving in the red sea. Once my mind was in Egypt, it seemed the next logical step would be that I should go visit my brother in France. And from France it was only a small hop to England to visit Matty Poppins. Being in Europe, I&#8217;d always wanted to spend some more time in Spain and try and learn Spanish&#8230; and by this point I was already thinking in large numbers of months of time required.</p>

<p>I thought for a long time if I should try and ask work for that much time off, or if I should scale back my plans, but both seemed to have major downsides. Either I&#8217;d miss out on doing some stuff I wanted to do, or I&#8217;d have a deadline to be back home by, meaning I wouldn&#8217;t have the flexibility to chop and change my plans at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>Eventually I decided that I should quit my job. That was an incredibly hard choice, because I actually really loved my job (although I&#8217;m sure I was hovering pretty close to burnout), got along well with the people I worked with, and liked the company I worked for. In a world where it&#8217;s common for people to hate what they have to do to get the money they need to live, it felt pretty irresponsible to leave such a comfortable position.</p>

<p>Having been on the road for over a little while now, I&#8217;m pretty certain it was the right choice. I&#8217;m  feeling tremendously privileged to be able put &#8220;real life&#8221; on the shelf for a while and treat life as the adventure it should be.</p>

<p>twelve months on from that day in June, my life hardly even resembles what it used to be. I&#8217;m pretty much completely recovered from the injury (only occasional minor tight muscle pain these days and even that is lessening) and taking full advantage of that every day. Instead of worrying about being late for work or if the thing I was working on is going to get finished on time, my concerns today are along the lines of &#8220;What should I spend my last day in India doing?&#8221; and &#8220;I hope I get a window seat for my flight to South Africa.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always thrived under pressure and I almost feel like last year was life&#8217;s way of saying &#8220;Hurry up and do awesome things, you can&#8217;t wait forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe that the adventure I&#8217;ve set out on will solve all (or even any) of the problems in my life, but it certainly hasn&#8217;t made things worse yet. Maybe when I&#8217;m old I&#8217;ll look back and wish I&#8217;d been sensible, and invested my savings more wisely, so I could die having a larger sum of money to leave to the children I&#8217;m not really planning on having&#8230;. but I seriously doubt it.</p>

    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/flying,/airports/2013/06/26/catching-a-flight-from-udaipur-airport">Catching a flight from Udaipur airport</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>I&#8217;m jumping out of order for a bit for a quick story about the joys of security theater in Indian airports.</p>

<p>I get dropped off at the airport by a taxi and head towards the door in which I can see signs pointing to departures and arrivals. I go to enter and the security guy on the door, holding what I think was an MP-5 machine gun, wants to see ticket and passport. Having only booked my ticket online hours earlier and having no printer I had no ticket to show him. He says I can show him on my phone, I pull up Trip-It and show him the flight details and confirmation number but he&#8217;s not happy because there&#8217;s no name listed so he sends me around to the ticket desk to get a ticket printed. After trying the next two entrances in the direction he gestured I realise the desks are basically just invisible slots in the glass front of the building.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a guy in there on his phone, but he doesn&#8217;t look over when I say nameste, nor when I knock on the window. A rather stressed out looking Indian man comes over and tries as well but the guy inside completely ignores both of us. Nice to know it&#8217;s not just because I&#8217;m a foreigner.</p>

<p>Finally, after waiting at the window for ages wondering if maybe I got there too late, another guy shows up in the window. I read out the confirmation number and he asks me to pass my phone in through the slot. I&#8217;m not keen on this, but don&#8217;t have another option, and he gives it back after entering something in his computer. He disappears for 5 minutes, then comes back and asks for my passport. He writes some stuff on a scrap of paper, stamps it and hands it to me.</p>

<p>I go back to the front door (keeping in mind, everything so far has occurred with me being completely outside the airport) this time armed with my hand written piece of paper; and this time I&#8217;m allowed in.</p>

<p>I walk the 20 metres towards the departure check-in part of the airport, and a guy at the entrance stops me and asks to see my ticket and passport yet again. Obviously the guys out the front can&#8217;t be trusted. He&#8217;s concerned that the hand written scrap of paper only says Bombay on it and doesn&#8217;t mention Udaipur. So another guy is called over to confirm that yes, my flight does actually leave from the airport I&#8217;ve shown up at. Phew!</p>

<p>I put my check-in bag on an x-ray machine conveyor belt, and at the other end it is stickered and looped with packing tape.</p>

<p>I finally get to the check-in desk. You know? The place where all of this stuff happens at real airports. There is no line. They take my hand written ticket and print me off a boarding pass. It sure is lucky they had security to check my hand-written unforgeable scrap of paper several times before letting me through here. I&#8217;d hate to think what horrible things might have occurred without all that &#8220;security&#8221;.</p>

<p>In order to get to the boarding area, I have to show my boarding pass and passport yet again. Surprisingly they&#8217;re not interested in checking my hand written ticket here as well. They are, however, concerned that my carry on bag has no paper tag on it, so they stop me while they find one and attach it to my bag.</p>

<p>I put my bag, laptop and contents of my pockets in plastic trays and send them through the x-ray machine, then line up behind 2 other guys at the step through metal detector, which seems to be going off for everyone.</p>

<p>There is a second metal detector, but it&#8217;s only for women, so I stand in this queue, starting to feel a bit uncomfortable how long my stuff is out of my sight and loose in a tray.</p>

<p>Each person in front of me sets off the metal detector, and then has to stand on a platform for a pat-down and a scan hand held metal detector that&#8217;s so over-sensitive it goes off for zippers.</p>

<p>I walk through the metal detector and it doesn&#8217;t go off. Huzzah! I&#8217;m still required to take the second metal detector scan + pat-down. Makes me wonder why they even have the step through one, but I already know the answer. Because more is obviously better.</p>

<p>At last I get over to the plastic tray containing my stuff, and find my bag has been taken aside. This means I have to wait for 10 minutes while one of the security people go through the bag of the man in front of me, and tell him to throw out his two containers of milk(?) in soft drink bottles. Meanwhile, 3 security people stand around doing nothing as there&#8217;s no more bags to x-ray.</p>

<p>Finally it&#8217;s my turn, I&#8217;m told to pull out <em>all</em> electronics from my bag, and lighters. They&#8217;re very certain I have a lighter and it needs to be scanned separately. I have no such lighter and I tell them several times, with them asking again probably 4-5 times.</p>

<p>My carry-on bag is nearly solely electronics. I empty everything out into a plastic tray, leaving some books and my passport wallet in the bag for them to rescan separately. Now I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s ok to re-pack my bag. They stamp the paper tag and ask for my boarding pass in order to write something down in their report.</p>

<p>At boarding, my ticket is scanned by one person, then a metre later it is checked by another guy who also wants to see my passport, and then again as I enter the plane a third man wants to tear off the stub of the ticket.</p>

<p>Good work India, another terrorist plot of boarding an airplane without having to jump through lots of unnecessary hoops has been foiled! Inconvenience and the illusion of added security continues it&#8217;s reign.</p>
