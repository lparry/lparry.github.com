    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/05/13/day-one">day_one</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>I spent my entire last night in Melbourne with my mind racing, completely unable to sleep. I think I nearly feel asleep for a bit at around 5am, and then was woken not long after by a notification on my phone lighting up the room.</p>

<p>By 6:30am when I planned to get up I&#8217;d completely given up hope of getting any sleep and got up and made myself a coffee, then zipped up my bag fully packed.</p>

<p>I decided at the last minute, that rather than throw out a bunch of socks and underwear that I didnt have room to bring, I&#8217;d take a throwaway back and my second piece of carry-on luggage filled with them, and then throw them out as I use them to ease into this having to do super regular washing.</p>

<p>James generously offered to come and pick me up and drive me to the airport and even parked so he could come in to see me off through customs. What a champ!</p>

<p>In the midst of all the excitement I completely forgot about applying for the Tourist tax refund thingy until I was already through customs and had already checked in most of the stuff I was going to claim back. It was only going to be $50, but I&#8217;m still disappointed that I didnt think to go and get the reciept stamped while I had possession of the stuff so I could have got the money.</p>

<p>I bought 2 bottles of no-name brand water on the way through the airport, a bargain at $5. I&#8217;d already split my credit card and debit card into being stored in two separate places and only had my credit card in my wallet, and for the privelege of paying by credit card they gave me a sweet 10% surcharge, obviously because the profit margin on those 25c bottles of water was no where near enough to cover credit card fees.</p>

<p>I got put in the very middle seat on the plane between two women, which meant both no view, and having to ask to get up every time I needed to go to the toilet. Still, it was better being between two small women that two large men as the arm rests were shared fairly rather than as some bullshit attempt to show who&#8217;s got the biggest cock.</p>

<p>I took with me one of those neck pillow thingies, which I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d used in the past and not found to be particularly great. I&#8217;d taken it because I figured it might be ok for one flight and I&#8217;d have no attachment getting rid of it as soon as needed. But it turned out the thing is amazing. Earlier in the year just on a flight to Wellington I&#8217;d gotten an incredibly sore neck trying to sleep on that short flight, but on the ~8 hours to Singapore I managed to sleep and sit lazily for the whole flight with my neck feeling great. So the pillow may not get turfed quite so early.</p>

<p>The stopover in Singapore was brief, only about 1 hour, so I didnt really get to look around, but they had free wifi so I checked the internets and filled in time. For a massive airport like that, the place felt like their aircon was hardly working. I re ckon it must have been nearly 30ºC inside.</p>

<p>The flight to Ho Chi Minh City was uneventful, although arriving was a bit of a debacle. I (and what seemed like every other non-Vietnamese person in the airport) had organised a pre-approved visa on arrival. I lined up for 10 minutes to submit the lettter &amp; paperwork and sat and waited. and waited. and waited. After about 40 minutes, there were no seats left and new-commers started lining up at the collection window as though that was going to get theirs processed faster.</p>

<p>After just over an hour they finally called my name and gave me my passport back, with which I could go through iigration and finally collect my bag, which had long since been pulled off the baggage collection belt and was sitting unattended with loads of other peoples stuff. It&#8217;d be a prime oportunity for someone dodgy to go through any bag they liked, but then I guess the only way to get to that part of the airport without being an official would be to take an international flight, so I guess that&#8217;s a reasonable bar to stop it from happening often.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d read about dodgy taxi&#8217;s at the airport and had the name of a repuatable company and an idea what the trip should cost. A guy approached me and I told him I wasn&#8217;t interested and kept walking towards where the company had a person who did the booking. The guy pulled out some ID that claimed he was a driver for the same company I was looking for, so I asked if he&#8217;d use a meter. He said yes, but then as soon as I showed him where I wanted to go he told me 600,000 Dong, or more than 3x the cost of a fixed-rate taxi to anywhere in the city, so I told him again nope, I&#8217;ll get a proper one thanks.</p>

<p>My taxi driver took me to the hostel I&#8217;d booked, and pointd me down a little lane way to it; Lucky too because without him I doubt I would have found the place. It was certainly tucked away.</p>

<p>The owner of the hostel sat me down and ran me through a map of everything there is to do nearby, and told me a good place to go and try pho bo (noodle soup). I went up to my room and had a quick shower to freshen up. First thing I did was brush my teeth with the tap water, right afterwards realising that pretty much everyone recommends against that. Oh well!</p>

<p>I went and got some dinner from the Pho Bo place, and quickly realised I have no idea how to eat noodle soup. It came out as a bowl of noodle soup (duh!) and about 5-6 plates with various different things on them. I watched some Vietnamese people who I was sharing the table with and tried to copy them, chopsticks in my right hand and spoon in my left, but funnily enough found my left hand is way to unco for that so I ended up alternating between just the spoon and just the chopsticks. The soup was ok, but I think I&#8217;ll stick to the non-soup dishes for the rest of my stay.</p>

<p>Not a bad first day.</p>

    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/05/07/last-minute-bag-choices">Last Minute Bag Choices</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>So I bought the 40L bag I’d been eyeing off last week. After doing a few trial packs with it, I’ve decided that I cant fit everything I want in it well enough, so tomorrow I’m taking it back to see what my other options are.</p>

<p>I can just about fit everything in the 40L bag, but it’s stuffed so tight that I have concerns about my laptop getting cracked if the bag were dropped, or something was dropped on it; and it doesnt give me any excess room whatsoever.</p>

<p>If I pull out my laptop &amp; camera bag, it feels like a better fit (still without a lot of room to spare, but I’m not scared stuff is going to get broken) so I think I’m giving up on keeping the possibility of doing carry-on only flights and resigning myself to having a separate daypack. With the laptop no longer in the 40L bag, it seems like a waste of space to have the separate front pocket &amp; laptop pocket, hence why I’m looking at swapping the 40L bag too instead of just supplementing it with a proper day pack.</p>

<p>Options I’m considering now (looking mostly within the same brand) are:</p>

<h1>Osprey Porter 46 + Some decent day pack</h1>

<p>15% larger, all in a single compartment rather than spit in two. This one still claims to be within maximum carry-on size allowed on most airlines. Not sure about which day pack to pair this with.</p>

<h1>Osprey Farpoint 55</h1>

<p>I’ve read this is basically the bag I’ve got, except with a 15L daypack that attaches on the back making up the extra 15L. I’d want to have a look and see that it’s not wasting space with another laptop pocket in the main bag, since that’ll be in the day pack.</p>

<h1>Osprey Waypoint 65</h1>

<p>50L Pack + 15L daypack. I wonder if as long as I’m resigning myself to always having checked luggage, maybe I should just make the jump to a pack where I’ll have quite a bit of space. Not so much so I can fill it up from the get go, but so I can maybe carry some useless stuff until I admit it’s useless, and so I have some extra room to pick up junk along the way?</p>

<p>I dont really know what path I want to go down at the moment; I’ve been reading so many people who say “Take less clothes, you’ll never regret it” but clothing wise it already feels like I’m going pretty light, and it’s all the other stuff that’s taking up lots of space. I’m definitely not willing to consider leaving the 11” Macbook Air or the camera stuff. The kindle seems pretty necessary. The spiky massage ball for my hip is not negotiable. I’m already down to a single set of poi and 4 juggling balls, so short of giving up one of those hobbies that are quite likely also good conversation starters there’s nothing there to leave.</p>

<p>I guess I have to admit that I’m not willing to make the sacrifices needed to travel with only one compact bag. Maybe this is one of those mistakes you have to make for yourself, or maybe that level of minimilist travel just isn’t for me.</p>
