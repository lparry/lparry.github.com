    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/08/19/india-part-2">India Part 2 - Train stations parties until the little hours of the night</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>The overnight train the second time around, from Varanasi to near Agra, was a bit of an ordeal. We showed up at the station at 21:00, one hour before the train was scheduled to depart at 22:00, and were soon told that the train had been delayed a few hours, now expected at 00:00. We went into the upper class and sleeper class reserved seating area to sit and wait and found it was full of people sleeping on the benches. One of the guys checking people were allowed to be in there went around and woke some people up, clearing enough seats so everyone could at least sit down.</p>

<p>We soon noticed what appeared to be rats lurking in the shadows underneath benches, occasionally making dashes in and out of the toilets. The toilets were a sight to not be seen. Wreaking of shit, the guys toilets consisted of three squats one of which had leaking plumbing that sprayed water at you as you first walked in the door, or went near the basin to wash your hands. How lovely!</p>

<p>The station we were at is quite a busy interchange station, so pretty much every 5 seconds there was an announcement, each preceded by Microsoft&#8217;s tada.wav sound. Not annoying in the slightest. I started watching my watch to measure the silence and got excited where there was no announcement for an entire minute! As 00:30 approached we got word there were further delays, and a later ETA, which when it came to be that time the train didn&#8217;t show and we didn&#8217;t get any new information. The guys who make sure that people in the waiting area are actually allowed there went home and suddenly the room was full of homeless people sleeping on the floor, even under the benches we were sitting on.</p>

<p>Finally at 03:30 our train arrived and we boarded, only 5.5 hours later than planned, and only a few hours before we were supposed to be arriving in Agra, which obviously wasn&#8217;t going to happen. Completely exhausted and out of patience from staying up so late, you can imagine how overjoyed we were to find a guy sleeping in one of our assigned beds, and used blankets and pillows in most of the remaining ones. A conductor kicked the guy out and sorted us out with new bedding and so we could finally get to sleep.</p>

<p>Waking up the next day we were told the train was somehow now every later again so we probably wouldn&#8217;t get to Agra until 16:30 so we&#8217;d be going to the Taj Mahal the next day instead, a fact that made Kim ecstatic as it meant we&#8217;d be there on her birthday!</p>

<p>At 14:30 we suddenly had to get up and get off the train as we&#8217;d arrived near Agra early-late somehow. We were given the option to visit the Red Fort that afternoon which nearly everyone chose to do.</p>

<p>It was a shocking day in Agra, with dark clouds looming, so it was no surprise at all when it started to piss down with rain soon after we arrived at the Red Fort and not stop while we were there. The fort itself was an amazing building, and even seeing it under such awful conditions everyone still really enjoyed it and I personally found it way more impressive and interesting than the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>That night back at the hotel we met the final two additions to our tour group, Brad and Brad from Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

<p>The next day we got up extremely early and headed to the Taj Mahal. We were pretty much the first people there which gave as a great opportunity to get some nice photos without too many people in them. I found the Taj to be pretty impressive from a distance, but it didn&#8217;t really have much more to it after that initial impression. I&#8217;m glad we got delayed the previous day, as I don&#8217;t think my impression of the Taj would be as good as that of the Red Fort if we&#8217;d been to see it in the heavy rain.</p>

<p>Because of the previous days delays we didn&#8217;t get the local bus that was on the schedule and instead got some private cars; definitely a bonus for what turned out to be a 6 hour drive to Tordi Garh, the old Palace in Tordi Village.</p>

<p>We were greeted by the &#8220;royal&#8221; owner (maybe he was a prince or something? King doesn&#8217;t sound familiar) and had a nice buffet dinner and drinks to celebrate Kim&#8217;s birthday. I was sharing a room with one of the Brads, and not long after going to bed he started to lose his balance and get vertigo every time he laid down and started to freak out a bit exaggerating that he probably had a brain clot or something, so he went off to see our tour guide and came back 10 minutes later looking quite paniced, and told me he was being taken into Jaipur hospital. We&#8217;re told he was ok, but he&#8217;d gone back to Delhi to head home so we didn&#8217;t really get to spend much time with him in the tour group.</p>

<p>In the morning I got up early with a small group and we walked up the hill behind the palace to the site of the old fort to have a look, see the view and have some chai and biscuits. It was a surprisingly challenging walk, from the ground it looked like a 10 minute stroll, but it ended up taking an hour, and the humidity was so high that every inch of fabric I was wearing was drenched in sweat by the time I got back down to the palace.</p>

<p>After getting back we went for a walk through Tordi village guided by the royal dude. Tordi is a tiny little village a few hours outside of Jaipur; small enough that tourists coming to visit still cause the kids to crowd around excitedly, asking for &#8220;one photo&#8221; with their friends and siblings so that they can shyly look at themselves on the screen afterwards. I think in the whole time we were there I didn&#8217;t get asked to buy anything even once, nor did I see a single piece of touristy crap for sale.</p>

<p>It was explained to us how the money raised by allowing people to stay at the palace and from the meals served there is used to help keep the town going, and how they discouraged giving the children lollies or money so that they don&#8217;t start expecting it, and preserve the awesome vibe the place currently has.</p>

<p>We made the drive back into Jaipur and checked into our hotel which was full of winding corridors and stair cases making it an interesting walk from the front door to the rooms that probably took more than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>We went on a quick tour around Jaipur to get our bearings, then headed to the local movie theatre to watch the current big Bollywood hit, &#8220;Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani&#8221;. The theatre itself was a very impressive building, especially on the inside, it felt like a palace. The movie was visually very colourful and entertaining to watch although I was surprised by how few songs there were; it was a 3 hour epic (with intermission) but I think there were only 3 songs in the whole thing. It was a bit tricky to follow what was happening at times since none of it was in English.</p>

<p>I went to the toilet in the intermission and it was crazy. I think I&#8217;ve been in mosh pits less crowded than that tiny room was.</p>

<p>The next day we headed to the Jaipur palace, home to a king with 100 wives to look after his needs. There was a courtyard where him and his many wives would party, all but his first wife who had to stay in a room separate from the others and could only watch. It seemed like a pretty shitty deal for that first wife.</p>

<p>We had our last dinner with the larger tour group that night at a rooftop restaurant that&#8217;s speciality was meat. I had a plate of various BBQ&#8217;d meats and it was delicious.</p>

  <div class="cont caption has_title">
    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/08/13/india-part-1">India Part 1 - Immense frustration</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>I&#8217;m going to prefix this by apologising that it&#8217;s ridiculously long; I really understand that quote &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the length of this letter but I didn&#8217;t have time to write a shorter one&#8221;. I&#8217;m struggling to keep up, this will probably be the last post I write in this format, which is probably for the best.</p>

<p>I arrived in Delhi quite late at night, about 1am, and was very glad to have an airport transfer already organised. The roads of India didn&#8217;t seem too crazy at that time of night, or at least no worse than Vietnam or Cambodia; how little did I know back then. I checked into my hotel, Hotel Perfect, and went straight to bed.</p>

<p>I woke the next day and went out in search of an ATM so I could get some Rupees and some breakfast. The ATM was easy enough, although the maximum withdrawal was less than AUD $200, another win for my overseas-transaction-fee free credit card. I&#8217;d hate to be getting socked with $5-10 foreign ATM fees for every $200 I needed.</p>

<p>Breakfast wasn&#8217;t so easy to find. The area the hotel was in, Karol Barg, seemed to be mostly closed, which seemed a bit silly in a country where it gets so hot to be shut for the coolest part of the day.</p>

<p>A very persistent &#8220;guide&#8221; and his auto-rickshaw driver finally wore me down after following me for about 15 minutes while I walked and failed to find anywhere open with food. They took me to a south Indian street food place where I had dosa and vegetable curry, which was actually really good, so I decided to stick with them for a while and have them show me around Delhi. That turned out to be a bit of a mistake, the next place they took me to a &#8220;handi-craft&#8221; market.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but on day one of visiting a country, before I&#8217;ve seen anything at all of the place, I have no interest in buying kitche souvenirs. Heck, on day 20 after having seen a bunch of the country I still don&#8217;t have the slightest inclination to buy souvenirs, and even less so to buy stuff so generic that you could think it was from anywhere in Asia.</p>

<p>I did a quick walk through, still trying to be polite at this point, but really just wanted to get out of there. Each shopkeeper insisted that I look in his store, &#8220;just looking is ok&#8221;, completely ignorant to the possibility that maybe I just didn&#8217;t want to look at their tacky trinkets.</p>

<p>I went back out to the rickshaw and asked them to take me to a real market, you know, the kind with the big baskets of spices and stuff that might make nice photos. They drove me to another shitty tourist shop (putting market on your sign does not make your shop a market). I was getting fed up with it at this point and didn&#8217;t even get out of the tuk-tuk and asked to be taken somewhere I could buy a chai.</p>

<p>They instead took me to the tourist travel agent to get a &#8220;free map&#8221;, which the guy inside told me cost 500 rupees, so I left empty handed. Next they took me to &#8220;a great place for tea&#8221;, which was another air conditioned tourist shop selling packaged dried tea. I told the guide to stop wasting both our time with tourist traps as I just am not interested, and asked him to take me to the sort of place where he would actually drink chai of a morning. I think he got a bit pissy but the rickshaw driver seemed to finally get it and walked with me down the street 100m to a little hole in the wall where we had tiny little cups of chai masala. It was very yummy, but the plastic cups smaller than shot glasses were not very satisfying</p>

<p>That night I met up with the tour guide, I guy from Udaipur named Mayank, or Moon, the English translation of his name, and the only other person starting the tour in Delhi, Nicolle. It turns out that most people on the tour would meet us in Varanasi, coming down form Nepal. We were briefed on what was planned for the next 2 weeks, filled out some forms and had an early night.</p>

<p>The next day we went on a tour of the old city, and visited a large mosque where they wouldn&#8217;t let Nicolle in at all, and they wanted you to pay $12 to take in a camera, so I went in by myself with no camera for about 5 minutes to see a very plain and uninteresting structure with people who may well have been homeless sleeping all around inside of it and left. Sexism in the name of religion&#8230; another mark against Muslimism in my eyes.</p>

<p>We next went to a Sikh temple, which was much cleaner, more welcoming, more attractive to look at, and was happy to give free meals to anyone regardless of gender, faith or skin colour; a bit of a stark contrast to the Mosque. We learned about how Sikh believers always carry some sort of a knife or spear, and never cut their hair or beards because they believe it shows their wisdom, and how large turbans are actually full of lots of hair. I guess I have got some good beard wisdom going on, but not so good hair wisdom :P</p>

<p>We then had breakfast in a little parantha shop that made some amazing food. I had a cashew nut parantha, a flat bread stuffed with cashews served with some vegetable curries, and it was really something special.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Nicolle and I  went in search of snacks for the overnight train, and made a trip to the police station to make a report about Nicolle&#8217;s camera that was stolen from her the day before. That night Moon took us to the train station where we boarded our overnight train where we had 3 beds out of a 6 berth sleeper carriage with a few regular Indian people in the other beds. For at least the first few hours the food and drink guys were constantly walking up and down the isle saying &#8220;Chai, chai, chai! garam chai!&#8221; (Hot tea) or &#8220;Omlette, Omlette, Omlette&#8221; and made it seem a bit pointless having brought our own snacks.</p>

<p>I got a pretty decent nights sleep and in the morning (with the train running a few hours late) we arrived in Varanasi. We checked into our hotel and took some time to freshen up.</p>

<p>We went and ate lunch at a very tasty restaurant, then walked down to the ghats. Nicolle and Moon went back to the hotel to relax, I decided to explore a bit more by myself.</p>

<p>I saw some guys getting their head shaved on one of the ghats, my hair was over due for a shaving so I thought why not. I tried to ask how much a few times but they kept replying &#8220;yes, shaving!&#8221; as though they didn&#8217;t understand English and I figured even if they tried to charge me 4x it would still be cheap. The guy rubbed some water into my hair (thinking back, maybe it was holy Ganges water&#8230; I really hope not), opened a new razor in front of me and put it in the straight razor and started shaving away. Once he was done shaving he started insisting on giving me a head massage, then arms, then another one of the guys there started massaging my other arm telling me how lucky I was to be getting massaged by two men. Right&#8230;</p>

<p>To be honest I wasn&#8217;t really enjoying it and just wanted them to stop so I could leave already. When they finally finished, suddenly the guy could understood English much better and wanted 1000 rupees for him, and 1000 rupees for the other guy (about AUD$20 each). I told them where no way in polite terms. They gave me a spiel about how normal price for Indians in 800 rupees (a crock of shit) and that 1000 each was a good price, and more of them started crowding around.</p>

<p>At this point I&#8217;m feeling a bit intimidated since I know they all have cut-throat razors, so I pull out my wallet, and give them all the money in the notes section of my wallet, which because I separate big notes elsewhere, was only 300 rupees. Still a huge ripoff, but a much easier to stomach one. They tell me they&#8217;re still not happy and want me to go to an ATM or to come with me to my hotel so I can get more money. At this point I&#8217;m starting to get pretty mad, but try and keep calm and tell them sorry but that all they&#8217;re getting.</p>

<p>Their tone suddenly changes and they say OK, and ask me if I&#8217;m happy. I tell them no, I feel like you&#8217;ve ripped me off (because they have). They then make me to do a chant with the &#8220;holy man&#8221; sitting under their umbrella, repeating his words after him. For all I know they had me saying &#8220;I&#8217;m a stupid white man and I promise to give you all my money&#8221; in Hindi.</p>

<p>When he finishes he puts a red dot on my forehead as some sort of blessing. Surprise surprise, I&#8217;m now told I have to make a donation for the blessing. I&#8217;ve had enough with keeping calm, I tell them they&#8217;ve already stolen all my money (a lie, but I have no qualms about lying to a pack of thieving liars) and I&#8217;ve had enough of their scamming, I stand up and storm off, half expecting one of them to follow me and rob me.</p>

<p>I try and walk off my anger from being taken advantage of, but the chaotic streets of Varanasi aren&#8217;t really a good setting for calming down so after storming around for a while I end up getting a taxi back to the hotel, going for a swim and writing the rest of the day off to read.</p>

<p>That evening we meet up with the rest of the group coming from Nepal at dinner.</p>

<p>The next morning we get up before sunrise and head to the Ganges for a sunrise boat ride. It&#8217;s supposed to be a slow journey where we are taken down the river by the running water, but the light wind over-powers that and we stay pretty much stationary until after about 20 minutes of not moving the boat boys give up and turn on the boat engine and take us up the river past all of the ghats. A ghat is basically a set of stairs leading to water, from with the locals do many things including bathe, do laundry and cremate their dead.</p>

<p>After a quick Chai on the side of the Ganges when we get back, in single use disposable ceramic cups none the less, Nicolle and I decided to head to the monkey temple which as the name implies is home to a lot of monkeys. The temple was&#8230; really just another temple. But the monkeys were cute and awesome. Unfortunately you&#8217;re not allowed to take cameras inside at all, which is a shame since I had zero interest in photographing their holy shrine of flaking paint, but would have loved to get some photos of the baby monkeys and their mothers.</p>

<p>Afterward we went for a wander about the street markets, where I took a photo of a guy charming a snake. I went to walk off and the guy stopped playing his flute, picked up his snake basket and started chasing after me and demanding money. I told him to put down the damn snake before giving him a few rupees.</p>

<p>That evening we went on another boat ride where we attempted to float little leaf boats with wish candles in them down the river, but the wind quickly extinguished everyone&#8217;s wishes. India can be a cruel place :P</p>

<p>I ended up deciding I was overdue for a &#8220;weekend&#8221; the next day, and it was a day leading into an overnight train to be followed by the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort in Agra, so I chose to sit by the pool (accommodation on this tour was far fancier than I&#8217;m used to) and read for the day to relax and recuperate.</p>

                    <p>Instead of following the common life path of getting married, buying a house, and having two kids, he's chosen to seek out epic adventures, see the world, and hopefully have great times that he'll reminisce about when he's old and senile.</p>
