    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/06/15/india-part-4">India Part 4 - India Flying solo, at one with the chaos</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>On my first morning alone in Udaipur I went for a bit of an aimless wander around, and ended up at the zoo, which with my typical travel luck, was closed that day. I had a bit of a walk around the gardens surrounding it which were very nice, and sat in the shade reading a book for a few hours.</p>

<p>I took a very round about walk back into town and stumbled across quite a long street market which was full of colour and activity, so I spent quite a while taking photos.</p>

<p>I organised a taxi up to see the monsoon palace for sunset, right up on top of the hill overlooking Udaipur. The views of the city were fantastic, but the gloomy overcast afternoon made the sunset into a non-event.</p>

<p>The next day I went back to see the zoo on a day that it is open, and instantly regretted coming. The few animals they had were in painfully small cages, which wreaked of shit; atrocious conditions that made me feel very sorry for the animals.</p>

<p>That afternoon/evening I got my flight to Mumbai on Air India. I&#8217;ve already ranted about how horribly over-the-top bureaucratic the whole thing was (here)[], but one thing of note that I didn&#8217;t look into until after I landed safety was Air India&#8217;s safety record. I found (this article)[] claiming they are the 3rd least safe airline in the world, ignoring the ones so unsafe they don&#8217;t count. Who needs bungee jumping when you&#8217;ve got dangerous airlines to travel with.</p>

<p>I got a taxi from the airport to a hotel recommended in the lonely planet (I had nothing planned when my flight took off, so the lonely planet was my only real option), and it was this cute little old school style taxi, just like in old movies, with a bench seat across the front and a roof so low my head nearly touched the roof.</p>

<p>When I arrived I found out that that hotel was full, but a helpful guy looking for a tip helped me find  a place around the corner that was nice and cheap, that was just a floor full of tiny shoebox private rooms, probably 1.5 metres by 2 metres. Good enough lodgings to spend a night, but the bathrooms were so horrible I didn&#8217;t wasn&#8217;t to stay more than the one night.</p>

<p>I was hungry for some dinner so I went for a walk to find that just about everything around seemed to be closed already at 11pm, but after walking past hundreds of shut shops, I found Leopold Caf√© from the book &#8220;Shantaram&#8221;, which saved me from having to stoop to visiting the golden arches I could see in the distance. The place for much larger and far busier than I had imagined it to be, with a whole team of waiters decked out wearing &#8220;Leopold&#8221; uniforms. I had a pretty nice curry there, then headed back to my shoebox to sleep for the evening.</p>

<p>I spent the next morning searching for a nicer hotel that I could afford and found a place that had a bit of an old mansion feel to it. I had a look at the room, it looked pretty nice and had an air conditioner so I agreed to stay, but later when I went to turn on the AC I was disappointed to find there was no power to it. I asked at reception about it and they told me it was an option extra which I wasn&#8217;t very happy with, especially since there was no fly screens on the windows. I ended up deciding that I didn&#8217;t really need the AC, and lucky for me there didn&#8217;t seem to be any mosquitoes in Mumbai.</p>

<p>After sorting out my room, I went and looked into booking a tour of the slums with a company that had been strongly recommended that used the money raised to run a school in the slums to educate the kids there. I was lucky and there was a tour leaving that day in about an hour, so I booked in and went home to change from my flip-flops into closed shoes.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting tour, showing how much industry goes on there from plastic recycling, where they sort the plastic by quality and colour and melt it down to make long strands which are cut into pellets to be shipped off to other countries to be made into all sort of stuff, to fabric recycling where old fabric is shredded and the fibres are spun into a thread which is then turned back into fabric, to burning off the paint from old oil drums and banging them back into shape to be repainted, refilled and reused. Apparently there are a few people making a ton of money from the slums, while the people who work and live there are in extreme poverty. A lot of the people actually sleep at night in the same factory that they work in during the day.</p>

<p>We were taken down a &#8220;lane way&#8221; that would have been only about the width of my shoulders and required us to bend down not because of a low roof, but because of low power lines, along which there were hundreds of tiny rooms each inhabited by a family. At one point we went past an area our guide had described as an open field used by the locals as a toilet. What it looked like, however, was a huge mound of garbage with some kids playing cricket on it not 10 metres away from another kid squatted down taking a dump. Lovely!</p>

<p>The next day I took a boat to Elephanta Island, to see the cave temples carved out of the side of the hill. The boat ride there was pretty choppy on account of the extremely high tides. I had a sea sickness table beforehand so I was fine, but there were a lot of Indian women throwing up onto the side of the boat. That&#8217;s not a typo, they weren&#8217;t managing to get it over the edge in the slightest.</p>

<p>The steps up to the cave were lined on either side by stalls selling the generic tacky souvenirs available everywhere in India, and roofed with blue tarps that did little more than stop any change of a breeze to ease the humidity. I don&#8217;t know how many people come all the way to Elephanta Island to buy their tacky jewelled elephant, or how they would pick any of those hundred basically identical stalls over another, but the shopkeepers obviously think it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>

<p>The first cave was quite impressive, with huge chambers carved from the mountain with lots of statues carved into the walls, but the other unfinished caves were less impressive, and finding a part where the &#8220;stone&#8221; had fallen away to reveal steel concrete reinforcing made me wonder just how authentic the whole place was.</p>

<p>The boat back seemed to take a lot longer than the boat there, with a few burst of monsoon rain, so I didn&#8217;t end up getting back until late in the afternoon and didn&#8217;t do much else that day.</p>

<p>My final day in Mumbai, and in India, was pretty packed full of stuff. I had a look through the museum in the morning before heading out to the ??? dobi ghat, a huge open air laundry, full of little troughs of water where people bash clothes clean, roofs covered in clothes lines and sheds where they boil water for the washing. It was an interesting place to visit, and explained why hotel laundry in Mumbai needed to be dropped off so early in the day.</p>

<p>After the Laundry, I walked down towards the Haji Ali Mosque, which is out on an island connected to the mainland by a long concrete walkway, with toxic Bombay water full of garbage on either side. I should have turned back when I noticed everyone coming back from the mosque was soaked from head to toe, but instead I took my chances and decided to try and time it right so I could get out to the mosque dry, timing my movement between waves. That was foolish and about half way out I got stuck in a crowd when a large wave hit the concrete wall, splashing up and soaking everything I was wearing with filthy water. It&#8217;s a damn good thing I had my phone and camera in my dry bag at the time!</p>

<p>I turned back without even getting to the mosque, and as I was leaving some heavy rain started to fall. While people ran for cover, I tried to find somewhere completely uncovered and took my hat off to try and get a bit rinsed off by the rain.</p>

<p>Next I headed to the Gandhi museum, which in typical fashion was closed that day for pest spraying, so I headed down to nearby Chowpatty beach instead. There was a roped off area along the shore that I asked a local about, and was told it was there to stop people getting sprayed with the toxic seawater from waves&#8230; So it sounds like the water pollution issue isn&#8217;t over-exaggerated at all.</p>

<p>I saw some kids jumping of a higher bit of sand doing flips and stuff, that I watched for a while before they dragged me over to sit with them and asked me questions and wanted me to take photos of them so they could see themselves.</p>

<p>On my long walk along the coastline, back to where I was staying, I was hit by some more dark clouds and heavy rain that I welcomed with open arms. It&#8217;s amazing how getting covered in filthy toxic seawater can change you opinion of how annoying monsoon rain is. I just walked along with a grin on my face, watching people run for cover when there was absolutely no cover to run towards.</p>

<p>I decided I needed a shower before I headed to the airport; I asked at my hotel but they told me there was no shower that I could use, so I went to a hostel around the corner and asked them how much it would cost just to use a shower. They ended up only charging 100 rupees, and I was happy to get cleaned up and changed into some clean clothes.</p>

<p>My taxi driver for the drive to the airport had Bollywood tunes that I could actually recognise playing on the radio, a fitting way to finish up my time in India.</p>

<p>I feel I will definitely be coming back at some point, probably in winter, well away from the monsoon. I can completely understand why the place is so love/hate with people. There&#8217;s a bunch of things about the place that frustrate and confuse me, but the colourful nature of the place, the amazing food and the friendly people (who aren&#8217;t trying to sell you shit) have won me over.</p>

  <div class="cont caption has_title">
    <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2013/06/15/india-part-3">India Part 3 - Three girls, a guy and a tour guide</a></h2>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>The next morning half the tour group boarded a train heading to Delhi to finish up their tour, but the 4 of us staying on and Moon went and got a local bus heading to a little village called Nimaj Bagh. The place were were staying was an old palace turned into a hotel, with beautifully painted trims on all the doorways, arches and windows. The place also had a pool which we hung out in all afternoon, making the heat a whole lot more bearable.</p>

<p>We got taken on another village tour, which was quite similar to Tordi Garh, but there was a tiny bit more evidence of western influence and capitalism here, in the form of a few more general store type shops and one place selling tourist trinkets. The kids, however, were just as beautiful and innocent, wanting little more than to see themselves on the screen of our cameras.</p>

<p>We also visited a temple that was decorated with carvings from before the time when Muslims had stated to influence India, with lots of carved women wearing nothing more than a sarong around their waist. It&#8217;s actually a bit sad to think about the impact Muslimism has had on India today. People are shocked and offended if a woman wears a singlet exposing their shoulders. The country responsible for the inception of the karmasutra is today inhabited by a generation of men who act like primary school boys, titillated by asking if you&#8217;ve had &#8220;the sex&#8221; with your past girlfriends and wanting to high five you. Quite frankly it&#8217;s depressing to see a country that was once so far ahead of the curve in sexual liberation, today being completely sexually retarded and ridiculously conservative, in the name of religion. It even seems from news events in the past little while that apparently rape is to be expected if you don&#8217;t dress &#8220;appropriately&#8221;; apparently the lack of exposure to women&#8217;s shoulders and lower thighs makes you less able to tell that a women showing some innocent skin isn&#8217;t asking you to have sex with them. Who would have known!?! End rant.</p>

<p>That evening we drove out to a hill with a lovely view of the sunset, where we had some chai. After the sun set we briefly went to a nearby lake and watched animals before it started to rain quite heavily and we headed back to our jeep and did the sides up before heading back to the hotel for a good nights sleep.</p>

<p>From Nimaj Barh we headed to Jodpur, India&#8217;s blue city. In the old town buildings are pretty much all painted indigo blue, apparently because it keeps the mosquitoes away. We spent the day exploring the Jodpur fort, which was fort-like, with Jodpur influences. Can you tell that my bullet point notes are lacking detail and my memory is failing?</p>

<p>That night we went to a local bar called Rocks bar, where I tried a bunch of local whiskeys, most of which were pretty alright, followed by a bunch of dancing which even in a very drunken state I had a lot of trouble getting into. Oh, and some local guy serving for the navy asked me to go home with him after the music stopped&#8230; just your usual night our in India.</p>

<p>The trip itinerary said the trip to Udaipur was by local bus, but we decided as a group that we&#8217;d done local buses already and would be happy to pay more to be able to make toilet stops wherever we pleased, and save a bunch of time. It also meant we&#8217;d be able to stop at a large Jain temple, the religion that our guide loosely follows. It&#8217;s an interesting religion in that it&#8217;s followers are supposed to shun technology; it&#8217;s monks take it to extremes and only walk to get around, even bikes are apparently to much technology. I&#8217;m told that it means the religion hasn&#8217;t spread very far around the world, simply because it&#8217;s preachers won&#8217;t board planes so can&#8217;t easily spread their beliefs in other countries.</p>

<p>During the drive it was very interesting to see how the landscape changed, starting off extremely dry and desert like, then becoming mountainous and rocky for a while, trailing into lush green rolling hills.</p>

<p>We finally arrived in Udaipur in the late afternoon and drove around the narrow hilly streets of the old city, where we went up lane way only wide enough for one car. As luck would have it a car was coming the other way and we had to back back down to the T-intersection to let it pass. Helpfully cars coming from the other two directions drove right up to our vehicle, stopped and every starting beeping their horns. Cars and tuk-tuks banked up behind them in both directions while impatient motorcycle rides forced their way through the narrow gaps. There was a lot of shouting, and a silly amount of horn usage as though they believed we were unaware they wanted to get past, and they didn&#8217;t realise that other self-centred idiots had blocked us in from every side so until one of the honking idiots yielded, nobody was going anywhere.</p>

<p>Eventually cars and tuk-tuks manoeuvred enough for us to get out of the way of the car coming down the road we wanted to go up, and we did a loop around to the hotel where we were again impatiently honked at by a taxi while we got our bags out.</p>

<p>With how impatient everyone on the roads seems to be, how little consideration people seem to have for how their actions are making things worse, and just how bullshit crazily people seem to drive, I&#8217;m honestly surprised that I didn&#8217;t see any real road rage. Everyone is in a needless hurry, but people seem to keep their cool pretty well.</p>

<p>After checking into our hotel we took a quick walking tour of the surrounding area, and then went on a sunset boat cruise on the lake that took us out past the two &#8220;floating&#8221; hotels that looked very upmarket. Our guide invited us to come to his home for dinner that evening, where his wife and grandmother had prepared a divine selection of curries. Moon insisted that it was custom for guests to eat before the hosts, so we dug in as they brought the various dishes out, and his little old grandmother who didn&#8217;t speak any English kept sneaking more naan onto our plates. Desert was goolab jamun, delicious doughy balls soaked in rosewater syrup.</p>

<p>While in Udaipur we did a tour of the very beautiful palace, took the cable car up to a lookout where the girls were swarmed by Indians who wanted to take a photo with them (a few even asked me, it was like they&#8217;d never seen white people before), and took in a show of traditional music and dancing one of which involved a woman dancing with an ever growing stack of pots balanced on her head.</p>

<p>One morning we were booked in to do a cooking class but I felt extremely nauseated during breakfast and decided food preparation was probably not the best idea. By lunch I was feeling fine again and came to the conclusion that the nausea must have been caused by the doxycycline I&#8217;d taken that morning on an empty stomach, an amateur mistake.</p>

<p>I spent the morning doing research into how to spend my time in South Africa and found a budget tour from Johannesburg to Botswana, which nearly fitted into the time I was there but started a day early. I made some enquires about changing my flight and if there was an seat on the tour, and was soon off trying to get a refund on my overnight train ticket and booking flight to get me to Mumbai sooner to give me a little extra time there.</p>

<p>Moon and the girls still on the tour said our goodbyes and they headed off to get their overnight train back to Delhi, while I stayed on in Udaipur for a few extra days.</p>
