I used to do a lot of Yoga back in my university days and I used to love it, but every other time I&#x27;ve done it since then the yogi&#x27;s have all fallen short and the classes have felt dull and uninteresting, and usually they seem to have every pose requiring ultra flexible hamstrings (which I don&#x27;t have), so I usually end up feeling like I&#x27;m not stretching/working anything else.</p><p data-reactid="58">Charlie&#x27;s classes however were much more similar to what I remembered from uni, a good level of challenge and more varied poses, so at the end of it I would feel like I&#x27;d used a lot more of my body. I found out she lived in India for a number of years doing yoga before she&#x27;d had her first child, as had my yogi from university, so perhaps that&#x27;s why their styles seemed more in tune with what I like.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="59"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="60"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977483096/in/set-72157651692973941" data-reactid="61"><img src="/assets/flickr/16/16977483096-tiny-620ceee240.jpg" srcset="

I wasn&#x27;t about to sign up for that, but it was apparently ok to go along just for the day, so I did. They were up to week 3 of the current course, so perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the best place to start but I gave it a go anyway.</p><p data-reactid="66"><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="67"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="68"><img src="/images/sanmarcos/tumblr_lw1ymvkD9W1qh2i8s.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Lake Atitlan" class="img-responsive" data-reactid="69"/><em data-reactid="70">A stolen photo of the big meditation pyramid</em></span></p></p><p data-reactid="71">The big pyramid temple has a strange entrance where you go down steps underground, then back up steps into the temple through a hole in the floor.

It was quite a challenge for someone who&#x27;s never tried it before; after about 15 minutes one of my legs was completely numb. I tried to manoeuvre it so the blood would flow again but it just wouldn&#x27;t wake up. After 20 minutes I didn&#x27;t care any more and made a bunch of noise switching my legs around so the numbness would stop.</p><p data-reactid="85">Next up we all lay on our backs, feet to the wall, heads towards the middle of the room, and again focused on breathing. Breathing in 5 seconds, holding for 3, then out for 5 seconds. Then 7-3-7, 9-3-9, 11-3-11 and finally 13-3-13. By about the 9 second breaths, I was really struggling to stretch out my breaths any longer.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="86"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="87"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16977610346/in/set-72157651692973941" data-reactid="88"><img src="/assets/flickr/16/16977610346-tiny-3bdeeb055d.jpg" srcset="

To be completely honest, I felt stupid doing this and didn&#x27;t feel like I got anything at all from it.</p><p data-reactid="113">Next up was humming meditation. We hummed to &quot;music&quot; (a seemingly random composition of drums, cymbals and other sounds) for about 40 minutes. This was actually pretty intense on my throat; I was struggling to keep a hum going and my lips were going numb. After humming, we did some more arm movements, pushing out bad stuff like insecurity, jealousy and hatred, and bringing in good things like happiness, confidence and gratitude. Strangely, this actually felt like it calmed me down a lot.

Yep, I&#x27;m totally sceptic about that BS.</p><p data-reactid="120">Next we did some writing meditation, which was basically writing out a bunch of affirmations. I don&#x27;t doubt that affirmations can be helpful, but this didn&#x27;t seem very sedative to me.</p><p data-reactid="121">Finally we talked briefly about my poi and juggling, and it sounds like how I&#x27;ve always said that they felt pretty much like meditation to me really isn&#x27;t far off. I guess I&#x27;ve been meditating in my own way for a lot longer than I realised, and in a way that&#x27;s a lot more fun.

I was keen so we met up the next afternoon and gave it a shot, but after asking some people in San Juan about safety on the road between there and San Marcos we were told there were sometimes bandits along there so we ended up getting a tuk-tuk from there instead, along what turned out to be a very hilly long road. I dunno if there used to be a flatter path before the lake level came up so far, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it would have been a very leisurely walk these days anyway.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="128"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="129"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16383431423/in/set-72157651692973941" data-reactid="130"><img src="/assets/flickr/16/16383431423-tiny-1ad8719dd2.jpg" srcset="
