He tells me he runs the brewery as a bit of fun, and to provide some jobs for the locals. Apparently the area wasn&#x27;t really on the tourist circuit at all back before he started up here, and now lots of people are coming to the area specifically to visit the brewery and then are told about the local natural attractions around to visit.</p><p data-reactid="39">Bobby makes some pretty tasty beers, from memory there were maybe 5-6 different ones on tap but I&#x27;ve neglected to keep any notes about what they were. They&#x27;re made in a sort of large scale home brew manner, using malt extracts and hops. I asked Bobby if he&#x27;s thought about doing it with actual grains (the all-grain homebrewer in my past believes it&#x27;s the only way to make exception beers), and he told me he&#x27;d originally bought a pallet of grain with the intention of doing it all that way, but the humidity in the area makes it near impossible to store the stuff without it spoiling and growing mould, which seems like a pretty fair reason for doing it the way he does.</p><p data-reactid="40">The place has a nice little restaurant that makes pretty good burritos and baliadas, but their most impressive menu option is the blueberry pancakes which have a very generous portion of fresh blueberries cooked into them. I think I ate them for breakfast nearly every morning I was there. They&#x27;re so good I&#x27;d probably recommend going their for the pancakes even if you don&#x27;t like beer!</p><p data-reactid="41">One night I got talking with an Irish guy named Johnny who is one of the most interesting people I&#x27;ve met on the road so far. He&#x27;s an Irish bloke who makes his living as a travel blogger, travelling 9 months out of every year and living in Thailand the other 3.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="42"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="43"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15852046620/in/set-72157649787007102" data-reactid="44"><img src="/assets/flickr/15/15852046620-tiny-8ab04541cf.jpg" srcset="

At one point a man got on, stood up at the front of the bus and asked me in English where I was from. After a little bit of small talk he switched to Spanish and started yelling something at the bus, then started digging around in his bag for something. I thought for sure we were being hijacked and he was about to pull out a gun, but then he actually pulled out a bible and continued to yell at the bus for 15 minutes, before taking of his shirt and showing that he was covered in religious (prison?) tattoos. A huge sense of relief washed over me when I realised he was a preacher and not a hijacker.</p><p data-reactid="61">Once I&#x27;d arrived in Copan and found somewhere to stay, me and a few guys from the hostel went to check out (probably) the only authentic German brewery in Honduras. We&#x27;d gone there at 3pm in the afternoon to have a beer or two and get something to eat, but ended up staying until about 11pm and drinking many beers.</p><p data-reactid="62">The brewery is run by an older German guy named Thomas, who&#x27;s imported all the shiny brewery equipment from Germany himself, and has big temperature controlled fridges for fermenting his 120 litre batches. He imports all the German malts himself and mostly brews adhering to the [Reinheitsgebot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot) (German beer purity law), although he tells me he does make a hefeweizen with cacao beans in it which sounds like it would be delicious! Getting shown around the back room and all the brewery bling had me reminiscing about my years as an all-grain homebrewer throughout university.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="63"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="64"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16453437188/in/set-72157650622765828" data-reactid="65"><img src="/assets/flickr/16/16453437188-tiny-0e50e6098f.jpg" srcset="
