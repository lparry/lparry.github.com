This was a huge blessing, as it saved me blowing a bunch of money on a tent, camp mat, sleeping bag, etc, that I would only have to give away afterward anyway. Even more awesome was Peter&#x27;s offer to handle acquisition of food and water in exchange for money and a shopping list.

Unfortunately, the talks were all great, and back to back, so I didn&#x27;t actually get much time to explore the hospital and didn&#x27;t get to the rec yard at all. I would have loved another 2-3 hours to explore, and a tripod to have a go at some real HDR photos.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="198"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="199"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/19931823731/in/set-72157653894545484" data-reactid="200"><img src="/assets/flickr/19/19931823731-tiny-4ef9699aef.jpg" srcset="

There is a big metal cover over the doors machinery and the doors actually work just fine without it, but nearly silently instead of the loud booming sounds.</p><p data-reactid="204"><div class="videowrapper" data-reactid="205"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twecNQlzBW4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-reactid="206"></iframe></div></p><p data-reactid="207">They told us that the sound of those doors has been sampled and used in lots of movies, for example Jurassic Park and The Empire Strikes Back.
