We had a free day here to do whatever activities took our fancy; some people went and played mini-golf, some went and played regular golf, but I opted for white water rafting down the White Nile.</p><p data-reactid="33">All up there was seven people from our Dragoman group who went along, who with our American guide Tyler made up a full raft of people. We got taken to the &quot;put in&quot; point where we were given some breakfast, sorted out with high-flotation life vests and paddles and then were led down to our raft for some basic training, which involved things like paddling in time, turning, getting down low in the raft, flipping the raft and climbing back in. It was all pretty straightforward stuff and the water was a lovely refreshing temperature. A lot of people struggled to get back into the raft unassisted, but I surprised myself by being one of the ones who could! I can&#x27;t even do a single chin up, but I guess climbing back into a raft probably uses a lot of the same muscles that I built up last year being stuck on crutches for nearly 6 months.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="34"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="35"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421378166/" data-reactid="36"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10421378166-tiny-17ea8931d6.jpg" srcset="

We went down the waterfall, which felt like a theme park flume log ride on steroids, then paddled as hard as we could for the bigger pool of rapids but the current was too strong and we ended up going down the less turbulent path.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="40"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="41"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421394005/" data-reactid="42"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10421394005-tiny-42b40c6ef5.jpg" srcset="

Perfect for someone like me who&#x27;s never done it before :) It&#x27;s not actually as scary as it sounds, because the White Nile river flow is very high volume, that means the rapids are really big, but they&#x27;re also really deep so there&#x27;s much less chance of coming into contact with rocks. Lots more exciting and safer to boot!</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="46"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="47"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421405434/" data-reactid="48"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10421405434-tiny-82f5eaf9c5.jpg" srcset="

When after the first two rapids Tyler told us we had about 45 minutes until the next rapid I initially thought he was joking. There was plenty of opportunities for us to jump in the river and just float along next to the raft.</p><p data-reactid="52">On the third rapid of the day the water surged right as we got into the biggest part of the rapid and flipped the whole raft. Finding myself suddenly underwater like that for the first time, I instantly forgot everything we were told about holding onto paddle and lost it right away. I tried to surface but kept coming up under the raft and its baffles. I started to panic a bit, but managed to calm myself down and realise that I can easily hold my breath for more than a few seconds, so I held my breath and fumbled my way to one of the sides of the raft and grabbed onto the rope. I struggled to keep my head above water while we were still in the rapids, but once we were past them it there was a pretty awesome wave of feeling alive!</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="53"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="54"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421420636/" data-reactid="55"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10421420636-tiny-1a73ac0083.jpg" srcset="

None of the old rapids still exist, and new ones have formed. We&#x27;re told that it used to be the best white water rafting rapids in the world before the dam was built, the &quot;put in&quot; used to be at the actual campsite that we were staying at, but now the river running past that area is significantly deeper and there&#x27;s no rapids along there at all, hence having to drive 40 minutes in the morning. I still thought it was fantastic fun, but it would have been great to be able to compare it to how it used to be.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="60"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="61"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421438276/" data-reactid="62"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10421438276-tiny-d8942b8c68.jpg" srcset="

It was an awesome feeling being in the tumultuous water, this time being well clear of the boat. It felt like being in a giant washing machine, with the water dragging you in every direction, rapidly one after another. It really gave you an appreciation for the raw power of the river.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="66"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="67"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10421446195/" data-reactid="68"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10421446195-tiny-9c2f8f7202.jpg" srcset="

The group was split in two since only 12 people are allowed in the forest at once, which was further split into two groups of 6 with a guide each. I thought that the forest felt quite a lot like the Australian rainforest around the area where I grew up on the Far North Coast of NSW.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="72"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="73"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10440627725/" data-reactid="74"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10440627725-tiny-4065c9d63c.jpg" srcset="

It has nearly 30 islands, its surface is nearly 2000 metres above sea level, and it&#x27;s stupidly deep. [Wikipedia says it&#x27;s rumoured to be between 44 metres (which seems like it should be shallow enough to prove or disprove) and 900 meters (now we&#x27;re talking!)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Bunyonyi). The was a sign on the bank that claims it&#x27;s 6,500 feet deep, or about 2000 meters, and since Wikipedia only lists &quot;rumoured depths&quot;, I&#x27;m going with that since the sign is more of a citation than the Wikipedia page has.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="128"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="129"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10440854335/" data-reactid="130"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10440854335-tiny-944eebccf7.jpg" srcset="
