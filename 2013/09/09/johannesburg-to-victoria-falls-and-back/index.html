I had been told the day before where the keys were to open the front door, the front verandah cage and the massive padlock on the front gate, topped with an electric fence, and had been told to go out and unlock all the locks, then come inside and wait looking out the window for the bus to show up. At the time I&#x27;d though it must have been a terrible neighbourhood to merit all that security, but having spent more time in South Africa I&#x27;ve found that pretty much everywhere has crazy levels of security like that so I&#x27;m not so sure anymore.</p><p data-reactid="36">The bus arrived on time and I was the first person to be picked up. Our guide David, an friendly guy with a goofy laugh and a missing front tooth, introduced himself and we headed off to pick up more people, two Australian sisters from Sydney, then two English guys, then two Swiss sisters and two American cousins. Quite a few pairs of relatives!</p><p data-reactid="37">We drove for a while before stopping for breakfast at a large service station, where we met up with another mini-bus full of people also on the tour. I picked up some suspect biltong to snack on during the trip here, which may have been a huge mistake.</p><p data-reactid="38">We drove another few hours before stopping for lunch, still in South Africa just before the Botswanan border. Just after lunch, while talking with some of the people from the other bus, I suddenly felt a bit dizzy and had to sit down. As the day went on I started to feel really bloated and got some really nasty stomach cramps; it felt like the symptoms of diarrhea except every time I went to the toilet I couldn&#x27;t do any more than a fart.</p><p data-reactid="39">The day dragged on and I felt worse and worse until we finally arrived at the camp ground at Elephant Sands at nearly 22:00... 17 hours on the road. I couldnt eat more than a bread roll at dinner and wasn&#x27;t in the mood to fuck around putting up tents in the dark, so I &quot;upgraded&quot; to stay in a room that night. It cost way to much for a very basic room with no glass in the windows, only fly screens; but I would have paid any amount at the time because I was feeling so awful.</p><p data-reactid="40">In the morning the room&#x27;s attached toilet became a wonderful investment as yesterdays bloated constipation turned into a number 7 on the bristol stool scale. The bloating and some of the cramps went away which was a welcome relief. I went to grab my bags and head over to the other people from the tour having breakfast when I suddenly needed to dash back to the toilet. Eventually I made it over to the bus, but had to make yet another trip to the bathroom before we left.</p><p data-reactid="41">People say nothing compares to the thrill of bungee jumping, sky-diving and a host of other adrenaline based sports, but I don&#x27;t think any of them could really compare to the thrill of having full blown diarrhea on a long road trip. The edge of your seat excitement, wondering if you&#x27;ll make it to the next rest stop before your belly decides it&#x27;s held things in long enough... It&#x27;s a thrill that I wouldn&#x27;t wish on anyone.</p><p data-reactid="42">Thankfully I made it through the 8-9 hours of driving without any accidents with pure good luck, I swallowed a shit load of Imodium but it did nothing to the consistency of the filth spraying out of my behind at each rest stop we stopped at.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="43"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="44"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9665072956/" data-reactid="45"><img src="/assets/flickr/96/9665072956-tiny-f228372561.jpg" srcset="

When we arrived there was a stall trying to convince us to rent rain coats but none of us did.

It&#x27;s a good thing that winter days in zimbabwe are actually pretty warm and pleasant!</p><p data-reactid="55">We watched someone bungee jump off the bridge over the falls, the same bridge where a bungee cord snapped a little while back while an Australian lady was jumping. She survived and now the bungee jump is run by a South African company and supposedly a whole lot safer now. I had been pretty keen on doing a bridge swing, but with my stomach how it was I decided that was completely off the table now.</p><p data-reactid="56">We went back to camp, with a stop in at the activities company to book in activities for the days we were there, and waited while dinner was being cooked... and waited... and waited. Apparently somebody had come and bought all the firewood, so the guides had had to buy some green wood and it wasn&#x27;t burning well so dinner wasn&#x27;t ready until after 10pm that night. Still feeling pretty awful, I went to bed before dinner was ready and only managed to eat because I got up to go the bathroom and saw it was ready.</p><p data-reactid="57">The next day I went and found a chemist, armed with my little book of how to deal with various travel illnesses, and got myself some antibiotics to kill whatever was in my gut. I took a double dose as recommended by the booklet and within just a few hours stared to feel a whole lot better. The cramps disappeared entirely and my belly stopped feeling constantly bloated. Lucky for me too, as I&#x27;d booked in for a helicopter flight that morning!</p><p data-reactid="58">It was the first time I&#x27;d ever been in a helicopter and I&#x27;d opted for the longer flight option that circled around over the Zambezi river as well as the falls. This turned out to be a good idea because it meant that there was only me and another girl from the tour, plus the pilot, in the helicopter, which mean that he only had to worry about putting on a good show for the one side of the helicopter. When we saw hippos, giraffes, and other wild animals, the pilot would circle around so we got a good view.</p><p data-reactid="59">The view of the falls from the air was spectacular. It was incredible to see all the previous sites of the falls, a deep canyon that zig-zagged across the land, all now covered in thick vegetation with the river flowing deep below.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="60"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="61"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9661888675/" data-reactid="62"><img src="/assets/flickr/96/9661888675-tiny-e5b31892c2.jpg" srcset="

The funny little squeaky sounds they make are not the sounds you&#x27;d expect from something as large as a rhino, and their little faces really look just like dinosaurs.

The drive back from dinner was done in one of the open safari trucks and oh boy was it cold.

After the 10th time I had had enough and sat down with the old ladies actually crafting things. The whole routine feels hospitable on the surface, but is thickly layered in desperation and annoyance and makes me not want to even look if I&#x27;m forced to look at everything. Even back home I avoid shops, I prefer to buy shit online and not have to deal with clueless sales staff, so being made to look inside a hundred stalls selling the African equivalent of tiny stuffed koalas and kangaroos is pretty much my version of hell.</p><p data-reactid="98">That said, I did look in one shop that had some very unique paintings and I even bought one. They had cutesy African animals juxtaposed with unlikely tools and equipment. For example two giraffes sharing iPod headphones, a lion doing weights holding a barbell over its head, a parachuting hippopotamus and a leopard being shot out of a cannon; just like you see in the wild. I wish I&#x27;d taken photos, but I&#x27;ve just realised I didn&#x27;t even photograph the one I bought so now I have to hope it makes it home in the post safely.</p><p data-reactid="99">After a stop in for some lunch we got a taxi back to the border, and Steven and Bernard crossed over as they were going swimming with crocodiles that afternoon. I stayed in Zambia and went to view the falls from that side. The view from Zambia was completely amazeballs. It just seemed like you could see more and get closer, without the mist in the air becoming opaque and blocking the view. Not that there wasn&#x27;t a lot of water in the air, the Zambian side made the other side look positively dry. I started to worry that even with my camera in a white water rafting/diving dry bag it was going to get wet.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="100"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="101"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9665199670/" data-reactid="102"><img src="/assets/flickr/96/9665199670-tiny-228261a150.jpg" srcset="

At first I was a bit concerned being up so close, but they really didn&#x27;t seem to even notice I was there so I followed them for about an hour taking photos. At one stage I used the flash and them a mother baboon started walking directly towards me and I got worried and walked backwards, but she just kept coming after me and many others following. I think they had coincidentally just decided to move further down the path right after my flash went off because they ended up going around me and continuing on down the path.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="122"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="123"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9665303404/" data-reactid="124"><img src="/assets/flickr/96/9665303404-tiny-881b5f3d07.jpg" srcset="

It seems that running water and electricity really are luxuries even in the tourist parts of Zimbabwe.</p><p data-reactid="128">We went as a group that night for dinner at a place called Mama Africa and I ate a traditional Zimbabwe hot pot that was supposedly spicy beef but I couldn&#x27;t detect even a hint of spice, nor could someone else who ordered it. That&#x27;s not to say it was bad, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t the spicy meal the menu described it as.</p><p data-reactid="129">The next morning we set off back to just across the Botswanan border to Chobe, a nice short drive compared to some of the previous ones. There we went on a game drive around the Chobe game lodge, a huge wildlife park teaming with wildlife. We drove along the river and saw loads of elephants and hippos heading to and from the water for a drink, and even a crocodile or two sunning themselves on the bank. Impalas frolicked, dashing about at a frantic pace leaping over ditches. Sadly the time of day meant we were driving towards the sun for almost the entire drive, and then away from a beautiful sunset; and also that all the cats were off sleeping, but it was still a great display of wildlife.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="130"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="131"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9665353292/" data-reactid="132"><img src="/assets/flickr/96/9665353292-tiny-1137699a9c.jpg" srcset="

This consisted of taking out shoes and wetting the soles of them with some sort of liquid that I was told was soda ash. This seems highly ineffective, considering we were also bringing tents with us covered in dirt and dust that did not need sanitizing.</p><p data-reactid="137">We arrived at the camp ground for the night pretty late in the afternoon and we greeted by a man who looked a lot like an African version of Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean. We had another buffet dinner, followed by drinking games, followed by the local entertainment of twp of the staff getting into a fight and one of the guys taking his pants off. I&#x27;ve seen sometimes where guys fight they&#x27;ll take their shirt off, but stripping down to a shirt and underwear to fight is new to me.</p><p data-reactid="138">The last day of the tour we had to get up stupidly early to get to the South African border before the churchies arrive and congest things. Apparently a lot of people in Botswana cross over into South Africa on a Sunday for church. The border crossing was trouble free, although we had to go and get something signed off after showing that we had our yellow fever shots because a few of us had been to Zambia, which slowed things down.</p><p data-reactid="139">We had a nice breakfast at a town in South Africa before doing a group photo and saying out goodbyes, after which the two buses went different routes and the larger group was split. Another few hours of driving and we were back in Johannesburg and dropped off at the various hostels.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="140"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="141"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9669468951/" data-reactid="142"><img src="/assets/flickr/96/9669468951-tiny-938758298c.jpg" srcset="
