A lot of the dirt roads leading up to the Serengeti park entrance was a very rich red, which made some beautiful vistas where you&#x27;d have a very pale green and yellow hill with a dark red line cut through it, with an almost painted looking red gradient fading down wind of the road for 10-15M and a few meters upwind of it. It&#x27;s hard to really describe it well with words, so here&#x27;s a photo!</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="51"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="52"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10000617295/" data-reactid="53"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10000617295-tiny-c3d85cbc7e.jpg" srcset="

They do have dedicated camp areas there, but don&#x27;t get the wrong impression. There are no fences and you really are camping out in the wild. We were instructed to set up out tents with a few meters gap between them, just in case elephants or hippos came through so that they&#x27;d have enough room to pass rather than just walking straight over tents; and not long before bed several people saw a hyena shaped silhouette with lit up eyes from the torchlight. Sadly, being a heavy sleeper, I slept through any animal sounds that may or may not have been made that night.</p><p data-reactid="80">We were instructed that if we woke up in the middle of the night and heard noises, to just stay in out tents and be quiet, and don&#x27;t turn on any lights. If you need to go to the toilet, hold it. If you cant hold it, wake up your tent buddy, shine a torch outside the tent looking for eyes, then go right there next to the tent while your buddy keeps watch and deal with it in the morning. I was glad to be someone who very rarely needs to get up in the middle of the night!</p><p data-reactid="81">We were up well before sunrise the next day for one of the major trip highlights, hot air ballooning over the Serengeti! We were collected in 4WDs and driven to the site where they where getting things set up. It was interesting to see how they inflate the balloons with huge fans to start off with the basket on it&#x27;s side. They then squeeze everyone into their compartments while it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s side and you feel a bit like an astronaut about to blast off to the moon, lying flat to the ground looking up towards the moon in the still dark sky.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="82"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="83"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10014682903/" data-reactid="84"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10014682903-tiny-40339c7c2c.jpg" srcset="

The interesting part we learnt about was that the non-monogamy/polyamory that goes on apparently works in both directions. A man has many wives, but if he goes to visit one and finds a spear dug in the ground outside of her house, it means she has a male guest &quot;visiting,&quot; and that the husband should go and find a different bed to stay in that night, we&#x27;re told all with no jealousy!</p><p data-reactid="215">I don&#x27;t think that means that a woman actually has multiple husbands, but it does offer a bit of an explanation why wifeless men aren&#x27;t rioting about there being no available women because of the greedy guys with all the cattle.</p><p data-reactid="216">After we arrived at camp, and those of us camping had set up our tents, we were taken on a village tour of Mto Wa Mbu village. We took a very long walk though their farms, through large fields of beans, tomatoes, tapioca, rice, bananas, and numerous other food plants. We were shown the different materials that the people used to build their houses. The cheapest materials being mud houses, the mid-cost ones being made of red bricks, and the most expensive also being the most ugly, cement houses.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="217"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="218"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10014900033/" data-reactid="219"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10014900033-tiny-1b5da2736b.jpg" srcset="

And boy were they common, the paintings here were 90% the same largely generic ones we&#x27;d seen from Zanzibar onwards. There was a token guy putting the finishing touches on a piece, but as always seems to be the case the piece was pretty much done and he was putting a border on it, so for all we know the paintings are mass produced in a factory and then that guy paints a border on when tourists come past. They&#x27;re all so same-y that I would not be surprised. It&#x27;s a shame they&#x27;re not teaching them to utilize their creative differences instead of teaching them how to be human photocopiers.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="223"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="224"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10014844536/" data-reactid="225"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10014844536-tiny-57ac828d92.jpg" srcset="

We saw the sign and were intrigued and asked about it, and they were all too happy to have us have a look inside at them cleaning and setting things up.

It&#x27;s made with a special type of banana and sprouted millet and fermented for a few days giving it a alcohol percentage of roughly 1-2%. The flavour was actually not particularly banana-ry, but the price was dirt cheap! 1000 Tanzanian shillings for 0.5L, or roughly $0.30!</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="236"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="237"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10014826325/" data-reactid="238"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10014826325-tiny-68755eb2b4.jpg" srcset="
