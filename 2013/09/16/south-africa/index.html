Safety, things to do, how pretty the city is... Johannesburg ranks very low and Cape Town generally ranks pretty well.</p><p data-reactid="30">My time in Johannesburg was pretty whirlwind-ish. I&#x27;d already decided that I didn&#x27;t really want to spend much time there and would rather get to Cape Town, but I wanted to see the Apartheid Museum and I needed to reconfirm that I was actually eligible for my Tanzanian Visa on arrival, otherwise I&#x27;d need to make the 100KM trip to Pretoria to visit their consulate.</p><p data-reactid="31">The visa thing ended up being a pretty simple phone call. They urged me to apply before hand, I explained that I wasn&#x27;t in Pretoria, they confirmed that I could get it on arrival. Booyah!</p><p data-reactid="32">I asked quite a few locals about safety in Johannesburg and if the whole danger thing was as big of an issue as people make out and was told I&#x27;d be fine as long as I stuck to safe areas. So none of the aimless exploring that makes travelling fun; just stick to the touristy spots and you&#x27;ll be fine... and feel like a tourist.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="33"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="34"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9760054951/" data-reactid="35"><img src="/assets/flickr/97/9760054951-tiny-eb0eb7d062.jpg" srcset="

For those as ignorant as I was, the South African Apartheid was a system of segregation enforced by the government, dividing up the whites, the blacks and the coloured people, not allowing the groups to mix or mingle and giving a load of preferential treatment to the whites while treating the black people like shit. Oh, and this was happening right up into the early 90s; It&#x27;s shocking to think that if I&#x27;d been born a South African I actually would have lived 1/3rd of my life under such a system. It made me wonder a lot about the white South Africans I was coming into contact with and wondering how they&#x27;d felt about the whole thing while it was privileging them. And about the black South Africans I met, and how I couldn&#x27;t fault them for being extremely bitter about the whole thing, still so fresh but being told to get over it.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="46"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="47"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9760255074/" data-reactid="48"><img src="/assets/flickr/97/9760255074-tiny-2e593a9d6d.jpg" srcset="

I dunno what they do to their potatos but they&#x27;re addictive, and those long boerewors sausages are great. Erin dropped around from her hostel around the corner and we hung out drinking beers for a while before I had to retire reasonably early for my shark cage diving the next morning.</p><p data-reactid="72">I got picked up at 5am and hopped into a minibus which I promptly fell asleep on and woke up a few hours later when we were arriving. They gave us a full english breakfast before fitting us with life jackets and getting us onto the boat and heading out to the site. The water around Cape Town in the middle of winter is hovering around 9-10ºC, so well-worn 7mm wetsuits were given out to us, which annoyingly meant that moving your arms too much would flush in new cold water into the suit.</p><p data-reactid="73"><!-- react-text: 74 -->They attract the sharks to swim by the cage by chumming the water with rotting fish guts and fish oil, and then lure them closer still with a fish head on a rope that they chuck in the water buy yank out of the sharks reach as it approaches.

They have a cage hanging off the side of the boat in which 8 people hop in, and then drop down in the cage and breath-hold to see the sharks. I was in the first group in the water and we were pretty stoked to see quite a number of 2.5-3 metre Great Whites pass by and under the cage at close range. After about 45 minutes in the freezing water, we hopped out and let 8 more people jump in for a turn.</p><p data-reactid="78">There were some volunteers up on the top deck of the boat who were trying to identify the sharks to track how many unique sharks there were, and how they behaved (ie. if they were just passing by, attacking the bait, returned attempts etc). From their count, we saw 9 different Great whites that day.</p><p data-reactid="79">After all the customers had a turn in the cage they let staff &amp; volunteers have a turn, and there were two extra spots so I jumped back in for another round. It turned out to be a fantastic decision on my part, as I while I was in the cage the second time a shark charged at the bait directly towards the cage and was too slow to turn after the bait was yoinked and it rammed right into the cage. Directly in front of me. It was fucking nuts, and the level of excitement in the cage was through the roof! Probably just as well it was mostly volunteers as I think some of the other people on the boat might have freaked the fuck out.</p><p data-reactid="80"><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="81"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="82"><img src="http://2.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/96/27/921d080be5f1bc3745a4a993c2556db4-cigar-smoking-tommy-gun-wielding-bear-riding-a-shark-is-probably-the-b.jpg" class="img-responsive" data-reactid="83"/><em data-reactid="84">I didn&#x27;t take my camera, but this is pretty much exactly what I saw</em></span></p></p><p data-reactid="85">Aside from the antics I witnessed from inside the cage, I was also privileged enough to see not one, but two sharks attacking seals on the surface (not sure if they got away, we didn&#x27;t see much after the initial splash) and we had a whale come up 15 Metres from the boat (with a whale watching boat following it :P).</p><p data-reactid="86">On the way back to shore we went through a channel called &quot;Shark Alley&quot;.

It just felt completely different to the villages we visited in India, or even the slums; I just got the feeling that if I was one of these people I wouldn&#x27;t want people coming to look at how shitty my living circumstances were. It was pretty heart breaking to see the poverty that these people are still living in; we saw one room of a &quot;hostel&quot; that was probably 3M x 3M, that was the home of three separate families.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="107"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="108"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/9760585025/" data-reactid="109"><img src="/assets/flickr/97/9760585025-tiny-4145500cb0.jpg" srcset="
