Everyone&#x27;s visa got sorted out nice and quickly, but there was some sort of hold up involving the truck. Something to do with the truck&#x27;s registration being changed over from English to Namibian and us not having the right [Carnet de Passage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnet_de_Passages) to go with it.</p><p data-reactid="30">To make better use of the time we set up the kitchen to make lunch there at the border, then after eating some of the group started having a game of cricket!

We leave the truck and sort out other transport to Nairobi, and then hope the Carnet gets sorted out while we&#x27;re in the Masai Mara (using smaller safari Land Cruisers again). 2. We pay a bond for the value of the truck, but apparently bond in Kenya don&#x27;t work like real bonds; it&#x27;s basically sunk money that you will never get back. Luckily the truck is on the books as being only worth $4k, instead of the probably 100K+ it would truly be worth. Still not a great option, we would need to dip into the kitty to cover it. 3. We pay a bribe to get them to make the entry in the book with the old registration, like every other time.</p><p data-reactid="39">Eventually  after about 2 hours, we were able to pay a bribe of a few hundred dollars to get the paperwork fudged by that same very ethical and totally not corrupt border official. The bribe actually had to be negotiated by our Kenyan cook Charles, because the border officials were scared of dealing with Steve,  a white guy who can look mighty pissed off when he&#x27;s not happy, and he really wasn&#x27;t happy.</p><p data-reactid="40">And so, from the very start we were exposed to the best of Kenyan corruption, and it wouldn&#x27;t be our last bribe in Kenyan either!</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="41"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="42"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10124606913/" data-reactid="43"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10124606913-tiny-21fd58f162.jpg" srcset="

So slow in fact, and with nowhere to stop the truck, that someone on board could hold it no longer and needed to pee in a bucket! Fun times!</p><p data-reactid="47">We stopped at Galleria shopping center to shop for supplies and buy some dinner in. My first impression of the Kenya based on this mall was that it&#x27;s a lot like South Africa. Everything seemed clean and modern, and generally much more developed than anywhere we went in Tanzania. It turned out however that a shopping mall is not very representative of a country; who would have thought it?!</p><p data-reactid="48">The next morning we again left the truck behind and split up into safari 4WDs, this time with our whole Melbourne crew &quot;Team Toto&quot; in the same vehicle! Things were actually pretty disorganised, our driver didn&#x27;t even know he was driving that day so he showed up quite late and had to stop to meet his wife along the way to get some clothes for the trip.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="49"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="50"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10124579975/" data-reactid="51"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10124579975-tiny-7f63088f21.jpg" srcset="

That certainly didn&#x27;t mean we had to drive along it slowly though, all the Land Cruisers flew along it at 90-100 km/h and feeling like we going to fly off the road at any moment. It probably didn&#x27;t help that our Land Cruiser was 30 years old and felt like the suspension was all the original parts that came fitted on the car when it rolled off the lot. :P</p><p data-reactid="61">At one point we slowed down to a stop, our driver spoke with another driver for a bit and then let us know that the brakes had failed. Excellent! We went to continue anyway but then the car wouldn&#x27;t start and we needed a push to get going again, thankfully a whole lot slower now that we weren&#x27;t able to stop ourselves.</p><p data-reactid="62">We drove to the park gate where they sorted out a replacement vehicle for us to go off in that afternoon while they got our one fixed up, so we didn&#x27;t entirely miss our afternoon game drive.</p><p data-reactid="63">Now if your thinking, &quot;Gee, that sounds like a pretty shitty day&quot; you&#x27;d be right at this point. So many things had gone wrong up till now that I felt like I would have been happy to just go to camp and forget the game drive, but I&#x27;m incredibly glad we ended up going because those 1-2 hours in the park that afternoon completely salvaged an otherwise terrible day and left us in great spirits for the evening!</p><p data-reactid="64">We drove straight in to where a lot of cars were following a leopard that was walking around near some bushland. It felt a bit like a circus with so many cars circled around with so little respect for the animals personal space. Where in the Serengeti the drivers stick to the roads and you get to see what you can see from there, in the Masai Mara it&#x27;s a free for all and they drive you right up to things, and the moment the animal moves so so all the vehicles in order to stay right up close. We pulled up probably only 2-3 meters away from the leopard, which honestly felt like we were getting way too close, but it made for some fantastic photos. It did mean that when the leopard glared in our direction, it really felt like it could just jump in the vehicle and kill the lot of us if it chose to.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="65"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="66"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10124707306/" data-reactid="67"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10124707306-tiny-ab59b52894.jpg" srcset="

Again we got right up close, front row seats, and turned the engines off. Up that close in near silence it was possible to forget the media circus that you were part of and really just enjoy watching the lion cubs play.

On one hand it made the place feel a lot more zoo like, or that we were all just a part of some horrible media paparazzi, and if our driver had stayed back on the road it would only really be disadvantaging ourselves because no-one else was and they&#x27;d all get in the way of us seeing anything at all. But on the other hand it felt incredibly special getting up so close the animals, and as Steve pointed out, it&#x27;s been like this for so long that the animals have never known it any differently so they&#x27;re not at all phased by the cars.</p><p data-reactid="89">Back at the campsite we happily drank some beers and recounted all the cool stuff we&#x27;d seen that afternoon and you would never have even known that it was the same day where all that stuff went wrong!

I got lucky and we had some extra time because the driver of the cab that Leigh left his phone in the night before was coming to drop it off. I managed to get to a bank and get it changed to USD and was finally able to pay the remaining part of my trip kitty. Such a huge relief after weeks of screwing about trying to obtain it!</p><p data-reactid="199">Our next stop was Lake Nakuru, where it was raining quite heavily and the campsite had turned to mud. The truck got well bogged as well pulled in and we needed to get a giant tractor to get it pulled out. We took the easy way out that night and 6 of us upgraded to one of the bungalows instead of dealing with tents that night. Apparently it&#x27;s the rainy season here, which was a shock to us since we were still in the southern hemisphere (ie. Technically winter, although not really cold) and I think most of use though it was going to be dry season everywhere we were going.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="200"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="201"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10125534353/" data-reactid="202"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10125534353-tiny-d32e84b6b9.jpg" srcset="

The lake has been flooding for a long time now and it&#x27;s banks are well broken, apparently there&#x27;s nowhere for the water to drain so it just continues to expand, even blocking of the main entrance into the park. There was quite a large forest near the waters edge that was so waterlogged that most of the trees had just plain fallen over, roots and all, and nearly all the flamingos that the lake is famous for are gone because the algae they come to eat is too deep for them to get to now.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="206"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="207"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/10125582223/" data-reactid="208"><img src="/assets/flickr/10/10125582223-tiny-f6c94734aa.jpg" srcset="
