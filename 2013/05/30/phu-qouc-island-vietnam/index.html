After about half an hour it bucketed down with rain, prompting me to check the forecast for the next day and it didn&#x27;t look great. 70% chance of rain and thunderstorms. Maybe a day for me to go without my phone and camera, wear contacts and take a rain jacket and expect to get really wet!</p><p data-reactid="60">I woke up the next morning and could hear from the traffic going past that the roads were still wet. I looked outside and saw that the sky was overcast and it was spitting a little. Bugger! I started to wonder if it was even worth going if it was going to be wet all day, but Nsit arrived at 8am as we&#x27;d agreed so I grabbed my bag + a rain jacket and jumped on the back of his bike. There were a few drops here and there but not enough to merit putting on the rain coat. It sure did look miserable though, but at least it was cooler.</p><p data-reactid="61">First stop was a winery that makes wine out of a fruit called the sim. I got to taste a few types, mostly very sweet wines. I felt a bit pressured to buy something, so bought a small bottle that was only $5. Nsit led me out into the orchard and we found some of the fresh fruit for me to try.</p><p data-reactid="62">We got back on the bike and headed off down a red dirt road, which was a bit scary with the recent rain meaning lots of mud and puddles, but I&#x27;m told the rain actually makes the road better so I&#x27;d hate to see how it is normally.</p><p data-reactid="63"><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="64"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="65"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/82aa08aa8132723f2d6875ccfe0c9a25/tumblr_inline_mnlae89zob1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="66"/><em data-reactid="67">Red dirt roads</em></span></p></p><p data-reactid="68">We stopped at a pearl farm, and where shown some oysters being opened and the pearls cut out of them. I did the expected walk around with zero interest in buying anything. I&#x27;m not into jewellery in the in first place, but pearls just seem very old fashioned to me. We left that place went went down the road to another one which I wasnt at all interested in and ended up taking more interst in the beach the farm was next to and the sheer amound of rubbish on it. A sad sight to see, which makes me appreciate the hard work by the people who go along the main beaches each day picking up all the new rubbish that&#x27;s washed to shore.</p><p data-reactid="69"><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="70"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="71"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/0d937288ce13fa7929833feabd0cea59/tumblr_inline_mnlahbq6eR1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="72"/><em data-reactid="73">Pearls...

There were small barbed wire cages called &quot;tiger cages&quot; that they&#x27;d put prisoners in wearing very few clothes in the hot sun, so that pretty much any time they moved they got gashed by the barded wire. There were maniquens set up showing some of the torture they did, burning prisoners genitals, driving nails through ankles, crushing their chest between two boards and even removing their kneecaps. Pretty messed up stuff. There was also an impressive tunnel on display that prisoners had dug out in order to escape.</p><p data-reactid="75"><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="76"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="77"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/35f4c501d79612fb90d08469a2a7eb8e/tumblr_inline_mnlam09tiu1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="78"/><em data-reactid="79">Coconut Prison</em></span></p><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="80"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="81"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/702e6abc3aff41f241474bde926c513b/tumblr_inline_mnlamvhAIr1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="82"/><em data-reactid="83">Tiger cages</em></span></p><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="84"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="85"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/aa74a286e8c0ccc16920a228689a9164/tumblr_inline_mnlaodBsTp1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="86"/><em data-reactid="87">Burning a guys junk</em></span></p></p><p data-reactid="88">The next stop was right across the road, the fish sauce factory. It was interesting to see just how manual the processing there was.

I walked up and down the beach taking a few photos, and found the sun had gotten really fierce now. I could hardly see at all without my sunglasses but I&#x27;d opted to wear contacts this day so there were not an option initially. Where all the sunglasses guys now, hey? I accidentally rubbed a contact out of my eye at one point, so i switched to prescription sunnies and things were a lot more pleasant. I went for a nice swim in the lovely warm water with a large number of Vietnamese tourists, and not another westerner to be seen. Afterward I set on a deck chair in the shade on the beach and had delicious shrimp and cashew nuts for lunch.</p><p data-reactid="99"><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="100"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="101"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/7c5999a7e51831b94b2bc6d33a974d2b/tumblr_inline_mnlavlEARR1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="102"/></span></p><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="103"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="104"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/c59a56fa6c1f06a8bb1d51d7a10d7d98/tumblr_inline_mnlawsOr2U1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="105"/></span></p><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="106"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="107"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/997ed48ce81cad41dfefeb31e218d619/tumblr_inline_mnlaxjFD8t1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="108"/></span></p><p class="flickr-image-container" data-reactid="109"><span class="polaroid" data-reactid="110"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/1e0e0e74d826ac1819f54dc85cc36e8c/tumblr_inline_mnlay89ZUl1qz4rgp.jpg" data-reactid="111"/><em data-reactid="112">It was super bright!</em></span></p></p><p data-reactid="113">After a few hours we headed off towards a temple along some rather sketchy roads, which I filmed a very shaky video of for a bit.

A little 11 year old boy shared some of the odd sour fruit with me and commented on my 1UP mushroom hanging off my bag, so later I got some ripe berries for him from one of the trees that were too high for anyone else to reach.

I felt a little bad for him since most people (and myself) keep walking on to the night markets, but I was still a little hungry on the way home so I stopped in for some more shrimp BBQed with garlic and chilli which were amazing. All the food here is so great. While waiting for the food to come I met some older Aussie travellers, probably about my parents age, and we chatted for a bit.</p><p data-reactid="180">After I ate I was pretty tired so I came home and slept.</p><p data-reactid="181">On the last day I decided to have a lazy day and give myself some time to actually write up these blog posts. I sat for about and hour and a half at a vietnamese coffee bar, observing how the locals drink their ice coffee very slowly so the ice melts and the flavour becomes a bit diluted; and generally lazed about enjoying the cool shade. I spent some time better organising my bag so that less frequently used stuff doesn&#x27;t need to be unpacked all the time, and even went for a run along the beach right to the end. The perfect way to end my time in Vietnam.</p></div></div><div class="blogPost__tags" data-reactid="182"><div data-reactid="183">Tags</div><div class="tagCloud" data-reactid="184"><a href="/tags/vietnam" data-reactid="185"><div class="tagCloud__tag" data-reactid="186">Vietnam</div></a><a href="/tags/phu-quoc" data-reactid="187"><div class="tagCloud__tag" data-reactid="188">Phu Quoc</div></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create','undefined','auto');</script></body></html>
