I'm not into jewellery in the in first place, but pearls just seem very old fashioned to me. We left that place went went down the road to another one which I wasnt at all interested in and ended up taking more interst in the beach the farm was next to and the sheer amound of rubbish on it. A sad sight to see, which makes me appreciate the hard work by the people who go along the main beaches each day picking up all the new rubbish that's washed to shore."

The ATMs have a very low per-transaction limit (which I think is actually a physical limit, more money would not fit in the money dispensing slot), but then have a fairly low total per day limit too (about $600). Combined this with the large time difference between Africa and Australia, and our Australian banks daily withdrawal limits that reset based on Australian time-zones... let's just say it made getting the large sums of money needed for the kitty quite challenging. In the end it took probably 15-20 separate ATM withdrawals to get the money required(ignoring the attempts where the ATMs were just plain out of money, because an ATM can only hold so much paper, and when your biggest note is worth $7 an ATM really doesn't hold very much), and then a few visits to banks to actually get the USD (Leigh and Nicci managed to clean our a few money changing places of all their USD). I found it doubley annoying because I'd only just been in Zimbabwe a few weeks earlier, where the ATMs dispense USD and I could have stocked up there, but the trip notes had misled us into thinking local currency would be acceptable and it seemed a lot safer than carrying thousands of dollars in cash around South Africa."

We saw 2-3 green turtles and a giant big loggerhead as well, some peacock flounders hiding on the sand, a reef squid , some nudibranch, lots of lobsters and hundreds of shrimp.

The barrels are all stripped down and rebuilt before use. * They make some big environmental claims, claiming they use 100% renewable energy from burning sugar cane husk, do an epic amount of recycling, lots more I don't remember now.

Kerosene burns cooler, and it needs a wick to burn, which means that fuel spraying off or being spilt are less dangerous (but still not good). You can drop a lit match into a bucket of kerosene-like fuel and it will go out. Do the same with a bucket of white gas and you have a huge problem.

I can feel this trip beginning to draw to a close, so I'll probably be seeing a lot of my Australian friends again in the not too distant future. I'd love to hold out just long enough to miss Melbourne's winter, but I'm not sure that I'm going be able to make it that far. I see challenges in my future readjusting to life in Australia and the ridiculously high price of everything, finding a new place to live, a new job to keep me busy, and trying to fit back into a friendship circle that has evolved so much since I last saw them; but those are all bridges I will cross as I come to them. For now I'm still relishing the last few months of this amazing journey. Thanks for following along the ride!"
