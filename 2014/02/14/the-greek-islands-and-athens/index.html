I&#x27;d planned on heading straight from there to Ikaria but the ferry to Ikaria didn&#x27;t run the same day so I stopped on Samos for a day and had a look around. I found a cafe with wifi and looked up some cheap hotels, then made the long walk to one of the nicer looking ones which turned out was even cheaper than the prices I&#x27;d seen online because it was low season.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="30"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="31"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12374456543/in/set-72157640970103395" data-reactid="32"><img src="/assets/flickr/12/12374456543-tiny-7a1819da56.jpg" srcset="

I was quite literally the only person in the whole hotel. They asked me what time I wanted to have breakfast the next day, so I made myself get up the next day at that time even though I didn&#x27;t feel like it, and found they&#x27;d laid out a small buffet for me, it was very sweet of them.

There was pretty much no one on streets and pretty much all the shops but restaurants were empty. It made a nice change after Turkey, feels like lazy Sunday every day, with nobody fighting to get my attention. At this point in the trip I&#x27;m very happy that things are quiet; I think that peak season in the islands would be horrible</p><p data-reactid="42">While in Greece I ate a lot of Mediterranean salads, which consist of a huge proportion of raw tomatoes, which in the past I have never really liked. Any other form of tomato I&#x27;m fine with, but I&#x27;ve never been able to get past the texture and flavour of raw ones.  I decided to try and push through that dislike and eat a salad every day until I either liked them or hated myself for doing it.  It actually didn&#x27;t take all that long to get to the point where I almost enjoy them, I think the olive oil and lots of great feta and the freshness of the tomatoes definitely helped. I&#x27;ve continued trying to eat any tomato that has ended up on my plate even after leaving Greece (I was wondering if it was just the Greek tomatoes I was liking) and it seems to have worked somewhat. I still wouldn&#x27;t seek out raw tomatoes just yet, but I no longer feel like I need to eat around them which is great. I don&#x27;t think there are any foods I don&#x27;t eat because of the taste/texture anymore!</p><p data-reactid="43">Out the window of my hotel I could see an abandoned old building over the other side of the bay so I ventured over and explored it a bit. Most of the walls (glass?) had been removed, and the place was mostly stripped out, but it didn&#x27;t look like demolition was in any way in progress and it had a bit of an spooky feeling to it. The rooftop would have made an awesome site for spinning some fire at night!</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="44"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="45"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12374932753/in/set-72157640970103395" data-reactid="46"><img src="/assets/flickr/12/12374932753-tiny-6b5bddd24d.jpg" srcset="

The restaurants are all really overpriced, the end of shoulder season meant that there weren&#x27;t many tourists around (which after a few weeks of not really meeting _anyone_ it gets pretty lonely and I&#x27;d decided maybe having _some_ tourists would be a good thing), and there didn&#x27;t seem to be anywhere you could go and just hang out. There seemed to be no public spaces, parks or even benches, all the beaches are lined by restaurant that want to sell you overpriced drinks or are covered in sun lounges that you have to pay for the privilege of sitting on. It seems like somewhere you come to in the high season with a bunch of rich friends to get drunk and party every night, and then sloth around on overpriced sun lounges to nurse your hangover.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="103"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="104"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12510160085/in/set-72157640970103395" data-reactid="105"><img src="/assets/flickr/12/12510160085-tiny-1433acb186.jpg" srcset="

It was all good stuff and we covered a good number of the ruins around the city.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="123"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="124"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12510842254/in/set-72157640970103395" data-reactid="125"><img src="/assets/flickr/12/12510842254-tiny-b3729cfe27.jpg" srcset="
