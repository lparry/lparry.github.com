I was sent into a little room with a towel to get changed into, which then turned out to double as a giant locker to lock my stuff up in.</p><p data-reactid="117">I was then sent downstairs into the actual bath area into a small marble room containing a hairy man sluicing water about. He sends me into the next room with a bit of a grunt and a point of his finger.</p><p data-reactid="118">The next room is built in the shape of a large cross with very high vaulted ceilings, and several smaller rooms opening off it. Inside it was quite humid but not hot. There nobody else in the room with me and every move I make seems to echo quite loudly.  I sit for a while wondering if I should be doing something, then try sluicing myself with some water and wait some more until eventually the hairy man returns and gestures that I follow him.</p><p data-reactid="119">He gets me to lie face down on a marble slab, with a semi-circle pillow under my face and a bit of pool noodle under my shins. He then pours warm water all over me, then scrubs me down with a loofah glove. Next he gets a pillowcase-like sack that&#x27;s full of soapy suds, fills it with air and then squeezes it out through the sack to make foam for the soap massage, which seems like pretty much a normal massage but with soap.</p><p data-reactid="120">I&#x27;m turned over and the process is repeated on my front, with the addition of some quite rough amateur chiropractic work involving crossing my arms over to the elbow and shoving until there&#x27;s crack.</p><p data-reactid="121">Finally I&#x27;m rinsed off with water, then led out to cool off and drink some apple tea and eat some fresh fruit before heading back into my change room to get dressed. I certainly walked away feeling cleaner than I had since going to Africa. It would be the perfect thing to tack onto the end of Rainbow Serpent Festival each year! :D</p><p data-reactid="122">Our next stop was Pamukkale, which is famous for its massive salt formation hill thingy which we first saw from right where the bus dropped us off.

I did some research and found out that the state it is in today is actually way better than when it got UNESCO conservation status in 1986, before which it had been royally screwed up. There used to be a bitumen road right up the slope (where you&#x27;re allowed to walk today, and where the man man pools are) and hotels built at the top on top of the ruins of Hierapolis; incredible to think they could let that happen. The waste from the hotels had just been pumped out onto the salt slopes, staining the whole thing dirty brown colours instead of pure white.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="135"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="136"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11926162064/in/set-72157639724831244" data-reactid="137"><img src="/assets/flickr/11/11926162064-tiny-805586e079.jpg" srcset="

Bodrum itself was a pretty horrible resort town; think beached completely covered in sun-lounges with loads of bright red tourists sunning themselves laid out on them... really not my sort of place. My lack of interest in the city combined with the inspiration to go diving from seeing all the information about how they lift the shipwreck relics from the sea bed had me leaving pretty quickly and heading for Kaş.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="199"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="200"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11925961955/in/set-72157639724831244" data-reactid="201"><img src="/assets/flickr/11/11925961955-tiny-0db1007c21.jpg" srcset="

I went out with a shop called Bougainville Divers with a fairly advanced divemaster/guide, Peter, who dives with a side mount setup (no tank on his back, they&#x27;re clipped loosely at his sides instead), a setup I&#x27;d heard about but never actually seen anyone using before. It sure is an interesting way to rig your gear and actually lends itself to travelling with your own gear quite well. From the feedback I got from him, it seems that all my shallow water pier diving back in Melbourne has paid off in spades and my trim in the water looks like that of someone with two or three times as many dives as I have done. A nice little ego boost!</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="205"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="206"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/11935191264/in/set-72157639724831244" data-reactid="207"><img src="/assets/flickr/11/11935191264-tiny-1ac1b6cbb8.jpg" srcset="

Others were much much older, with broken amphora (ancient ceramic jars) and ancient stone boat anchors being all that was still evidence that it was a ship.</p><p data-reactid="223">While in Kaş I got in touch with some people through couchsurfing and met up with them; Ümit, a Turkish dude who spun fire poi and Maie-Anna, a girl from Germany who lives in Kaş now and was bursting at the seams with energy.

I could see where the floor of the second floor would have been, with the regularly spaced holes in the wall where the floorboard supports would have been. Another day I swam out to a not-so-secret cave and found that some of the ground I was standing on taking photos that earlier day was actually on top of an huge arch, probably 40 meters above the water and rocks.
