Thoughts of spending Christmas day in Scotland in shorts and a T-shirt went through my head. It turned out there were about 10 other people with the same issue, and what has happened was that one bag had gotten stuck on the other side of the conveyor belt and knocked a dozen bags off out the back.</p><p data-reactid="38">I got rugged up and then got the bus into the city to meet up with Leigh and Nicolette, and their reaction on my arrival about my giant moustache was just the kind I was hoping, awe and disbelief.</p><p data-reactid="39">We got another bus out to their place at Leith to drop off my bags, then headed out to have dinner at a nice pub nearby their house. The place made a great rabbit burger, and we caught up and talked about past and future travel plans.</p><p data-reactid="40">Leigh had to work the next day, Christmas eve, so Nic and I hung out for the day and got things together for the Christmas dinner.</p><p data-reactid="41">We were actually house sitting for Nic&#x27;s workmate Dave, so we took my bags with us and dropped them off at their office, then went out and had an amazing Scottish breakfast for just £4. It had everything; bacon, eggs, flat sausage, round sausages, black pudding, beans. So unhealthy yet so very delicious.</p><p data-reactid="42"></p><p data-reactid="43">We went down the street to the nearby Lidl and shopped for some pork to roast and some veggies, and some bacon and eggs to make for  breakfast, then ducked down to a big off licence to stock up on what seemed like plenty of beers.</p><p data-reactid="44">We took it all back to the office and hung out there cutting out letters for a very sweet video Nicolette put together for Leigh, and waiting for Dave to finish at work so he could take us to his place before heading off to visit his family.</p><p data-reactid="45">Dave had kindly stocked his fridge with beers for us as well, and with bacon and eggs and all sort of other good easy to prepare foods, so we definitely weren&#x27;t going to be going thirsty or hungry.</p><p data-reactid="46">Leigh arrived back from work and we cracked open some drinks and watched some stuff on Netflix and kicked back. A bit later in the evening Matty P arrived, who also had to work Christmas eve and then drive all the way up from Nottingham. It was great to have everyone together in one place again.</p><p data-reactid="47">The good times continued and we all stayed up until 4am, drinking beer, talking shit and watching shows.</p><p data-reactid="48">We woke up fairly late Christmas day, feeling pretty rough, but after a few drinks our hangovers disappeared. We actually ran out of beer, even though it felt like we had more there than we could possibly drink, but a nearby store was open and we solved that problem pretty easily.</p><p data-reactid="49">We prepared the pork roast and the veggies and put them in the oven, and we rewarded a few hours later with a very delicious Christmas dinner.</p><p data-reactid="50">On boxing day we finally made some use of the breakfast food we&#x27;d purchased and made a feast of bacon, both kinds of sausage, eggs, bacon and beans. Epic as always.</p><p data-reactid="51">We cleaned up Dave&#x27;s place to leave it as we found it, then went out looking for a pub where we could get haggis, neaps and tatties for a late lunch, to make sure we ticked all of the boxes for a visit to Scotland.</p><p data-reactid="52">We found a great place that had movie theatre seats with the names of all the characters from train spotting and I got my haggis fix with a couple of nice ales.</p><p data-reactid="53">Matty let slip that he&#x27;d never been to Edinburgh before so we all decided we should get a bus over to the royal mile, the street that leads up to Edinburgh castle and have a walk around.</p><p data-reactid="54">It was very pretty up there, but icy cold winds were blowing through, so we went down the other side of the hill to the Grassmarket and had a beer in the oldest pub in Edinburgh (Maybe even all of Scotland?). We had a look at a few other pubs along the same strip before heading back to the house.</p><p data-reactid="55">Matty offered that I could come back to Nottingham with him for NYE, and after looking at the ludicrous prices of hostels in Edinburgh over that period it was the only sensible choice. Places were asking £60-70 a night for a bed in a 16 person dorm. Fucking crazy!</p><p data-reactid="56">Anyway, we said our goodbyes to Nicolette and Leigh and then set off on the long drive from Edinburgh to Nottingham, 4-5 hours finally arriving at 1:30am. It felt nice to be back at my home away from home again.</p><p data-reactid="57">Between Christmas and New Years I spent a lot of time hacking on my blog, dumping Tumblr as a platform because it didn&#x27;t fit well with my not-always-online work flow.</p><p data-reactid="58">We also revisited a few of my favourite bars around town, the Canal House and Brewdog being the primary haunts, trying all the new ales they now had on tap.</p><p data-reactid="59">For my birthday, New Years Eve, we got some tickets to go and see a chap-hop rapper, Professor Elemental. For those who&#x27;ve never heard of chap-hop, it&#x27;s a hilarious genre of hip-hop performed by very proper, steam-punk-esk British gentlemen, rapping about important things like tea, being British and fighting trousers. Here&#x27;s a video clip to give you an idea of what it&#x27;s like:</p><p data-reactid="60"><div class="videowrapper" data-reactid="61"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eELH0ivexKA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-reactid="62"></iframe></div></p><p data-reactid="63">The night has a fancy dress steam punk theme, which made my moustache very well received. I even had a few people so impressed that they were buying me drinks. Sadly it didn&#x27;t seem to provoke such a positive response from the ladies :P</p><p data-reactid="64">I got a chance to actually meet Professor Elemental before he was on, who said that he was well jealous of the moustache and I got a few photos of us together.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="65"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="66"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14316422983/in/set-72157644891794991" data-reactid="67"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14316422983-tiny-2a71b42590.jpg" srcset="

They have various code wheels that are each electrically wired differently, and each have a number of modes, each set to a different letter, so that the input letter undergoes many mutations.

The machine would stop when set of code wheels lined up in an electrically complete manner, and then that configuration would be tested against a German message to see if it was the correct code for the day.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="80"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="81"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14109710727/in/set-72157644891794991" data-reactid="82"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14109710727-tiny-17e0d8bf53.jpg" srcset="

Some people had gone out barefoot without a jacket, which would have been hell. It wasnt a very pleasant start to the day but I figured I&#x27;d take advantage of it and didn&#x27;t go back to bed.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="124"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="125"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14273158356/in/set-72157644891794991" data-reactid="126"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14273158356-tiny-826d6e727c.jpg" srcset="

Nothing I saw had the features I&#x27;d like at a price I was happy to pay so I&#x27;m still using my trusty GX1 to this day.</p><p data-reactid="130">Later I went to Notting Hill to meet up with a guy from couchsurfing who had organised a juggle jam there.
