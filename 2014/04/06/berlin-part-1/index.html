We arranged to meet up for dinner and she offered to give me an introductory tour of the city. It was pretty lucky timing as Erin was leaving Berlin for a month just a few days after I arrived.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="33"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="34"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13575837835/in/set-72157643245435323" data-reactid="35"><img src="/assets/flickr/13/13575837835-tiny-4898d19bdd.jpg" srcset="

It was quite the whirlwind introduction to the city, we even visited a small Christmas market that was up and runing very early and got to have some gluhwein! Delicious spiced wine served hot, perfect for the cold nights leading up to Christmas. It was lovely to see Erin again and it felt like a really nice way to get to know the city being shown around by someone who obviously loves the place.</p><p data-reactid="39">I feel a bit bad about having zero photos with Erin or the places we went to go with this part of the post, but at times while travelling I&#x27;ve been hit by &quot;photo sorting fatigue&quot;, which leaves me in a state where I think to myself &quot;if I don&#x27;t take any photos I wont have to sort them!&quot;, which leads to gaps like we have here.</p><p data-reactid="40">We met up again the next day to go and visit Tempelhof Park, an old airfield that has been turned into a public park, but still has all the runways and stuff there. It&#x27;s kind of surreal to be wandering around on what quite obviously was once an immense airfield, with people jogging past or cycling on bikes.  These days there&#x27;s a community garden there and areas dedicated for having BBQs and stuff.  It seems like it would be a lovely place to spend some afternoons at in the summertime, and would make a stellar venue for a music festival.</p><p data-reactid="41">We went out and ate pizza that night with Erin&#x27;s housemates, Nicole and Nicole, as a chance to meet each other and see how we got along, and to see about the possibility of me moving into Erin&#x27;s room while she was away. The two Nicoles were both lovely and I thought it would be neat to live in a typical German apartment for at least some of my stay in Berlin. They were happy to have me take the room, so I got to move in a few days after Erin left.</p><p data-reactid="42">In my last few days staying in the hostel I met a Dutch guy named Harmen who was a bit of a history buff and seemed like a nice fellow, so we decided to explore some of the city together. We went to the Holocaust Museum, which was very interesting but there was just too much information there to process it all, so by 3/4 of the way through I was skipping reading 90% of the text and was pretty well museum-fatigued.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="43"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="44"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525055773/in/set-72157643245435323" data-reactid="45"><img src="/assets/flickr/13/13525055773-tiny-6b90a85ad6.jpg" srcset="

I remember we covered the World Wars in high school, but I don&#x27;t think we ever even touched on the Cold War (I guess because Australia played no part in it, and our history classes seemed to have been very biased towards things that Australia took part in, rather than important events that shaped the world as it is today.</p><p data-reactid="56">I never really enjoyed history at school, but I now looking back I think that was largely because of the incredibly narrow focus that my small rural high school had in its classes.  The stuff I&#x27;ve learned about while travelling about the history in a bunch of other countries has been fascinating. Far more interesting than hearing about Australians being slaughtered at Gallipoli for the hundredth time.</p><p data-reactid="57">The Topography of Terror museum was another really good museum, covering the various groups involved in carrying out the atrocities of WWII. It focused a lot more on the &quot;who&quot; and what they did. There were some very interesting perspectives there, but again too much information to take it all in in only one visit.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="58"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="59"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13525606303/in/set-72157643245435323" data-reactid="60"><img src="/assets/flickr/13/13525606303-tiny-ec4672a5b6.jpg" srcset="

If you&#x27;ve read my post about Turkey, you&#x27;ll know I adore Turkish food, but being newly in Germany we were really wanting to try some German food and it honestly felt a bit disheartening that a single culture had so completely squeezed out all others in the food scene in this part of the city.</p><p data-reactid="64">I&#x27;m would think there&#x27;s a saturation point for number of kebab shops you really need on any one street, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the streets of Kottbusser tor crossed that point long ago.</p><p data-reactid="65">We ended up caving in and getting Turkish food since there seemed like there was no other option, and it was quite frankly disappointing.
