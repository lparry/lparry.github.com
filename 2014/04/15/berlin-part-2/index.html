A band called [The Trouble Notes](http://www.thetroublenotes.com/). One guy planing an electric violin, one guy finger picking the heck out of a guitar while also using it as a percussion instrument, and another dude sitting on a unique drum that was just kind of a square box. They had a very beautiful sound and were so damn good I stopped and listened to them for probably an hour.  I even bought a CD to support them, even though I have nothing to play it in. I also got a flyer for a show later in the month in a very obscure warehouse venue.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="36"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="37"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13553720455/in/set-72157643245435323" data-reactid="38"><img src="/assets/flickr/13/13553720455-tiny-895c7f2427.jpg" srcset="

To find out they&#x27;re now planning on building along most of that strip, including a section currently occupied by an African Youth support centre who are being evicted, is terrible.

The venue was an old building hidden down a very dark alley, surrounded by building that felt like they were largely abandoned. It felt like the kind of place you went down to get stabbed, but it turned out fine for us. The Trouble Notes put on very good show, even if the support act was a bit too emo and the venue was super smoky.  It really feels like I got in a time machine and went back 20 years to be back in a place where you can smoke in public venues.</p><p data-reactid="115">I spent a couple of days exploring the various museums on the Museum Island.
