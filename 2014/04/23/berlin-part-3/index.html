It was a great exhibition, but it&#x27;s crying out for a bigger space. The exhibition is overflowing with so much stuff to show that half of it is hidden behind little flaps you open or in drawers that you pull out, which isn&#x27;t really compatible with having the place so packed full of people that there&#x27;s no room to open the exhibitions.

They even had gluhbier, spiced beer served warm that was rich and a little sweet. Naturally I had to try all of them.
