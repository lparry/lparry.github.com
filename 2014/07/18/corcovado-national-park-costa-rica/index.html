We hadn&#x27;t discussed food beforehand and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get stuff for them as well or what, but I got myself a lot of energy dense food so I was sure I&#x27;d have enough to make it in and back again comfortably without carrying too much weight. Basically a can of tuna for every meal, some mixed nuts and some muesli bars and a 2.5 litres of water.
