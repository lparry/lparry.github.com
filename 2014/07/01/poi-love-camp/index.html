I&#x27;ve previously learned a lot things only in anti-clockwise, so while I can do a lot of different things I&#x27;m often limited in what I can move between seamlessly because I&#x27;m not comfortable with the direction required to do so.

Sort of like the old rubbing-your-tummy-while-patting-your-head, but on steroids. It&#x27;s actually kind of funny to see how badly behaved my left hand can be when I&#x27;m doing something else with my right. Either hand can do it&#x27;s part separately easily, but combined the left just falls apart. These skills become really important for Hybrids where one hand traces out one pattern while the other traces out a completely different one, creating some very beautiful combinations.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="92"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="93"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14349469704/in/set-72157645015360162" data-reactid="94"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14349469704-tiny-d7584cb7e0.jpg" srcset="

Thankfully a little bit of practice has improved things a lot but I still need to work on this a lot.</p><p data-reactid="98">We did some work on counting different parts of motion in order to fit patterns to music better. Counting downbeats feels really natural to most people, but doing so means that most patterns repeat on an odd number, which when put to 4/4 music makes things complicated. For something simple like a 3-beat weave, you&#x27;re stuck repeating it 4 times over 3 bars of music before things line up again.</p><p data-reactid="99">While I can follow the theory about this stuff, I struggled really hard to actually find the beat a lot of the time.

From the first time I saw these on a video on Youtube I&#x27;ve been in awe, and then when I saw the $1500 price I was in even more awe. Getting to actually spin them was amazingly, fun and kind of disorienting (they&#x27;re super bright), but also kind of terrifying. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re probably pretty tough, but the though of having to pay for them if they got broken meant I was probably more worried spinning them than I&#x27;ve ever been with fire.</p><p data-reactid="106"><div class="videowrapper" data-reactid="107"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rXfYzFGL99Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-reactid="108"></iframe></div></p><p data-reactid="109">Jon and Jonathan brought along a lot of (at the time) not-yet-for-sale Flowtoys products which we all got to play around with. Lots of stuff from the new modular capsule line-up, capsule handles, compact capsule flower-cap poi, dual capsule tube poi, even capsule staffs! The capsule handles are so nice I&#x27;m pretty much converted to the idea of lit up handles, and I really liked the compact flower-cap poi.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="110"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="111"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14350320165/in/set-72157645015360162" data-reactid="112"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14350320165-tiny-9a6dca0876.jpg" srcset="

One day we made a visit to the nearby hot springs. There&#x27;s natural warm water coming down the hill, but it&#x27;s been routed into some concrete pools to make the bodies of water big enough to really swim it. It was a very relaxing way to spend a few hours just hanging out enjoying the water.</p><p data-reactid="116"><div class="videowrapper" data-reactid="117"><iframe width="1280" height="720" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DPQi4KNHonM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-reactid="118"></iframe></div></p><p data-reactid="119">We got invited to come along to a local festival and rodeo where the group performed in the bull ring with LED poi. The PA did not have any way to connect an iPod so we ended up spinning to their selection of music, some Latin-American pop music songs from the charts. The crowd loved it and some people were even actually asking afterwards about getting the group to perform at other events. It was my first time in front of a big crowd and it was heaps of fun.</p><p data-reactid="120"><div class="videowrapper" data-reactid="121"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6n_n9iDN5Do?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-reactid="122"></iframe></div></p><p data-reactid="123">After the performance Jonathan decided he wanted to spin poi in the ring with the bulls. The locals weren&#x27;t so keen on him doing this, but they he was able to partner up with a local guy who was shitfaced drunk, and tried to tie up a baby bull. The guy had somehow miscommunicated that Jonathan should try and tie up the bull&#x27;s back legs up while the local guy grabbed it around the neck, which lead to some hilarious attempts to get it tied up while the announcer heckled him in Spanish.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="124"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="125"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14327229196/in/set-72157645015360162" data-reactid="126"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14327229196-tiny-180adc8cb6.jpg" srcset="

It was run by a lady named Tao, who showed us how they made their chocolate, grinding the cocoa beans in a juicer with some cocoa butter, then put in a conching machine that rolled the chocolate over for 3 days to get it silky smooth. We then got to take a batch from 3 days ago and make our own blocks of chocolate with our own choice of added flavourings.  I made mine with crushed coffee beans, chilli flakes and sea salt. It turned out really tasty and didn&#x27;t last long after I started eating it.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="130"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="131"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14370570903/in/set-72157645015360162" data-reactid="132"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14370570903-tiny-2acfcc997a.jpg" srcset="

We had a nice lunch when we arrived, then went out in the surf and did some body surfing. It was incredibly fun and reminded me how much I enjoy the ocean. We had our afternoon poi class by the shore, then had dinner at a local restaurant before making the trip back to the finca.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="136"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="137"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14350077512/in/set-72157645015360162" data-reactid="138"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14350077512-tiny-ca848abf65.jpg" srcset="

It was the first time I&#x27;d spun with fire since way back in Thailand, so I was a little timid about it and only felt up to spinning the first night, but it was great to see everyone else busting out their best performances. Especially enjoyable were Thomas spinning like a mad man to some crazy French psy-trance, AlienJon&#x27;s beautifully synchronized slow swinging pendulums to an Ott song, and Nick spinning to &quot;I&#x27;m too sexy&quot; :P</p><p data-reactid="142">After everything was done and dusted I hung around at Finca Mia for an extra few days afterwards. It was sad to see the group diminish but great to get to spend some extra time with the others who stayed on.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create','undefined','auto');</script></body></html>
