Montezuma is described by guidebooks and Lonely Planet tourists as some beautiful and undiscovered hippy beach town, so I went there expecting maybe something like Byron Bay was 10-15 years ago.</p><p data-reactid="38">I was sorely let down, and I feel all those people need a strong reality check. The place is horribly overrun by tourists. It felt like the last real local had left years ago and now there is nothing but pot smoking gringos, pretending they&#x27;re in some hippy paradise. Or maybe that is hippy paradise, and I&#x27;m just jaded. Having grown up close to both Byron Bay (when it was far less developed than it is today) and Nimbin (where at least there are pot smoking locals too), I felt Montezuma brought nothing of interest to the table.</p><p data-reactid="39">I had a huge amount of trouble finding a decent room. Most places I tried were full up, with the remaining places either being empty and super creepy, or without lockers. Not cool at all with the reputation this place has specifically for thieves breaking into hostel rooms. Eventually I found a place with room for me but it was a complete dive.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="40"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="41"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535853397/in/set-72157645450071209" data-reactid="42"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14535853397-tiny-9205ba92e5.jpg" srcset="

For a town that was full up in terms of accommodation, it was strangely like a ghost town during the day.

The walk to the falls was pretty easy, a lot of rock hopping over the steam leading away from the falls. The bottom fall was very beautiful, with lots of people swimming in the pool at the bottom or sunning themselves on the surrounding rocks. It looked like it would be very dangerous to jump off, but that didn&#x27;t stop some folk.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="54"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="55"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14535670980/in/set-72157645450071209" data-reactid="56"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14535670980-tiny-bc4a261c77.jpg" srcset="

I actually managed to catch a couple before they had fully broken, a sensation that feels much faster and a whole lot more fun. I ran into Kaya and Francisco again and it turned out they were heading up the peninsula in their car the next day, the same direction as me, and offered me a lift to Liberia. Score!</p><p data-reactid="114">The drive up the peninsula had roads of quite varying quality. From Santa Teresa to the close ferry port was pretty OK. From there to the far ferry port was crazy bumpy and torn up so we crawled along very slowly for that part, but once we were past there the roads were pretty great so we made good time.</p><p data-reactid="115">Kaya and Francisco kindly dropped me off at a nice little hotel in Liberia, where I spent my last night in Costa Rica before getting the bus to the Nicaraguan border early in the morning.</p></div></div><div class="blogPost__tags" data-reactid="116"><div data-reactid="117">Tags</div><div class="tagCloud" data-reactid="118"><a href="/tags/nicoya-peninsula" data-reactid="119"><div class="tagCloud__tag" data-reactid="120">Nicoya Peninsula</div></a><a href="/tags/costa-rica" data-reactid="121"><div class="tagCloud__tag" data-reactid="122">Costa Rica</div></a><a href="/tags/montezuma" data-reactid="123"><div class="tagCloud__tag" data-reactid="124">Montezuma</div></a><a href="/tags/santa-teresa" data-reactid="125"><div class="tagCloud__tag" data-reactid="126">Santa Teresa</div></a><a href="/tags/surfing" data-reactid="127"><div class="tagCloud__tag" data-reactid="128">Surfing</div></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create','undefined','auto');</script></body></html>
