So much better than the 1-2 hour tastings where you&#x27;re rushing everything so you don&#x27;t run out of time. I think it also helped keep things relaxed knowing that trying everything was impossible. I&#x27;d done the sums and worked out that even just a 30ml shot of each beer would have meant drinking over 30 litres.

They claim to have been serving beer there since 1189AD. The pub is partly carved out of a sandstone cave, giving it a cosy atmosphere.

Presumably it was for unloading casks of ale back in the days (and maybe even still today?).  There we had a few strong craft beers (some well over 9% ABV), which didn&#x27;t help with the way we woke up feeling the next morning. In case you can&#x27;t guess, it wasn&#x27;t fantastic.</p><p data-reactid="85">Once we were up and going the next day, we made a visit to the op shops in the rich part of town.

Matty and I got the bus to Victoria Station, then headed straight to Camden to have Lunch at a nice pub Matt knew. Their menu contained the &quot;Cheese and bacon dirty burger&quot;. How can you go wrong with a name like that?</p><p data-reactid="141">After lunch we headed to a pub called The Old Haberdashery, where we were meeting up with everyone. Amanda and Luke, Leigh and Nikki, and a few other people we know who happen to be in London and had the afternoon free all made it along.</p><p data-reactid="142">After a lot of beers and reminiscing, we headed to the Boom Festival teaser party, our main event for the evening, which turned out to be a terribly organised disaster.</p><p data-reactid="143">We spent two hours waiting in line to get into the venue, and this was with everyone having pre-booked tickets, the event had sold out. There was a cloak room line that didn&#x27;t move whatsoever in the 15 minutes I stood there before decided I wouldn&#x27;t bother. I&#x27;d guess another 2 hours to cloak an item, and another 3-4 to get it back at the end of the night.  A stupid token system at the bar meant you had to queue up twice when you wanted a drink, or buy loads of tokens and risk having a bunch left over at the end of the night. There was way too many people packed into the tiny venue making the place so unbearably hot that we went outside to the smoking area just to get out of the heat. This is in London at the end of Autumn! I was so hot that I was comfortable outside in just a T-shirt for ages before I stopped feeling overheated.</p><p data-reactid="144">I&#x27;d love to say even in the face of all that I had a good time, but I didn&#x27;t. Pretty much everything about the night sucked. I was getting so mad about how poorly executed everything was that I got a yelling at from Nicolette about how negative I was being. I completely understand not wanting to make a bad situation seem worse than it is, but when the dust settled the next week I don&#x27;t think anyone had a positive word to say about the event. I don&#x27;t know how Boom Festival could let such a farce of a party tarnish their brand like that.</p><p data-reactid="145">We left before the event finished, as soon as the trains to Cambridge were running again. Like sleepless zombies we endured something like 3 changes back and forth onto buses because of weekend track works. Thank you Amanda for staying awake and making sure we got there in the end!</p><p data-reactid="146">In Cambridge we were staying at Amanda&#x27;s good friend Andrew&#x27;s place. When we arrived we walked in, he handed us bacon sandwiches (what a champion!) and then we all lay down and got some much needed rest.</p><p data-reactid="147">Andrew was heading off to visit his family, so we were sort of house sitting for him for Amanda and Luke&#x27;s last few days in Europe. Cards against humanity (The UK version) was played. £65 of fireworks were purchased and set off in a nearby field (45 seconds of non-stop explosions). Cheese, wine and beer was consumed. Good times were had. No photos were taken.</p><p data-reactid="148">After our few days there, Matty drove Luke and Amanda to London.  By the time we got there, it was peak hour, so we stopped at a suburb in the outskirts and had a few drinks until the trains would have quietened down. We said our goodbyes and wished Amanda and Luke well on their American travels, before making the long drive back to Nottingham.</p><p data-reactid="149">For my penultimate weekend in England, Matt kindly sorted us out some transport so we could go and check out the one real thing on my list of stuff to see in England: Stonehenge. I think the desire to see it stemmed from the movie European Vacation, which is kind of lame, but seeing the real deal was pretty cool.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="150"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="151"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12844633393/in/set-72157641676939995" data-reactid="152"><img src="/assets/flickr/12/12844633393-tiny-83129436ab.jpg" srcset="

We went to a nice pub called &quot;The Cask&quot; for some delicious ales and some gourmet burgers, and a lot of catching up. We talked &quot;shop&quot; for a little while and it was reassuring to still be able to feel like I&#x27;m not too far out of the loop. I guess as quickly as tech changes, the things people enjoy ranting about change much more slowly.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="283"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="284"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12847002555/in/set-72157641676939995" data-reactid="285"><img src="/assets/flickr/12/12847002555-tiny-be2efe0548.jpg" srcset="

I stumbled back from the bus station to Matty&#x27;s place and promptly passed out.</p><p data-reactid="289">The next morning Matty made us an epic breakfast for lunch, then we set out to make one last visit to all the pubs in town before I left. In at Brewdog we had a nip of [Tactical Nuclear Penguin](http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/214) each; one of their rarer, strong (32%), exotic and expensive drops.  Thankfully at the Brewdog bars at least they&#x27;ll sell by the 30ml, instead of having to buy a 330ml bottle. It was superb, but it is an impossible beer to follow as the flavour is just so intense.</p><p data-reactid="290">On my final day in England, we drove out to a nice country pub. Sadly it had a rather poor selection of ales, so we drove right back into town and found a place doing an awesome Sunday roast for lunch. That pub was conveniently located near the building which was used for Wayne manor in one of the Batman films, so we checked that out too. It&#x27;s an impressive mansion with a huge green grounds surrounding it.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="291"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="292"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/12847030535/in/set-72157641676939995" data-reactid="293"><img src="/assets/flickr/12/12847030535-tiny-28422afffc.jpg" srcset="
