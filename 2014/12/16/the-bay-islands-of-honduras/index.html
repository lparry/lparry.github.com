The reefs were healthy looking, some of the walls were fantastic, the there was a good amount of aquatic life around. Big crabs, lobsters, cowfish, drumfish (especially the juveniles), bearded toadfish, free swimming green moray eels... plenty of cool stuff every dive.</p><p data-reactid="43">During the week on Utila I ended up diving with about 5 or 6 different shops, and got a much better idea about the things that are important to me in picking where I want to do more training. Some had tiny boats and some had fairly big boats. Some went to the better diving on the north side pretty much daily, others only went 1-2 times a week. Some were so relaxed about safety that they weren&#x27;t even doing a head count, let alone boat roll calls, when diving north side (2 hours from the inhabited part of the island, pretty poor IMO) while others were clearly following good procedures.</p><p data-reactid="44">One night I was in a bar (ok, nearly every night... often it feels like more people are on Utila for the parties than the diving) and I got talking with some guys who turned out to have a set of fire poi and some kerosene, so we all headed to the beach to spin fire. It was my first time spinning with real flames in about a year, but it was also the first time I know of that I&#x27;ve been videoed, so I can actually show more than just still images for a change.</p><p data-reactid="45"><div class="videowrapper" data-reactid="46"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LMa0Ox5I3N4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-reactid="47"></iframe></div></p><p data-reactid="48">Looking at the video afterward, I can see a lot of places where I was falling into pretty dull repetitive sequences, but I still think there&#x27;s some good stuff in there. I feel like I&#x27;m a shit load better today, but then again I mostly spin LED poi so I probably cant do everything I can do now if I was using fire poi.</p><p data-reactid="49">Later that night I went along to a beach party and a couple of other spinners where doing their thing. I asked if I could have a go and the small crowd seemed to really like it. I had a few people come up to me randomly in the bar afterwards and ask about it, if I was a part of the performers. Lots of encouragement and support, pretty damn good for someone who hates being in the spotlight, I think it helped a lot with my fears and anxieties.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="50"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="51"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16013168646/in/set-72157649802065395" data-reactid="52"><img src="/assets/flickr/16/16013168646-tiny-8c45aee9fa.jpg" srcset="

A baleada is basically like a big cheesy quesadilla with different fillings, like chicken and avocado, which I would then apply liberal amounts of hot sauce to. A place on the island called Mamma Rosa Baleada had them for just a few bucks and they were so big they hung over the edge of the plate, so I ate there every day, sometimes more than once.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="56"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="57"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15853182307/in/set-72157649802065395" data-reactid="58"><img src="/assets/flickr/15/15853182307-tiny-53bddff395.jpg" srcset="

The first of those is the sand flies. The bastards are everywhere and insect repellent doesn&#x27;t work for them. One day just before (or maybe just after) rain, they were super intense. Horrible itchy bites all up my legs :( Some people claim that baby oil on your legs will stop them because they cant land or drown in it or something, but I tried it and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Maybe I needed to shave my legs to make it work. Way worse than mosquitos.</p><p data-reactid="62">The second pet peeve was the motorbikes and taxis that are ruining Utila. For a tiny little 1 road strip, there&#x27;s a horrible amount of traffic constantly zipping past, just barely missing people. They nearly always seemed to be full of lazy locals, which makes a nice change from seeing them full of lazy tourists.</p><p data-reactid="63">In the end my pick of the dive shops for Utila would be Utila Dive Centre, they ran a very professional environment with quality gear, they have a number of boats of different sizes and I just got a good vibe from them. Of course I wasn&#x27;t ready to commit to anything without having also checked out Utila&#x27;s neighbouring island, Roatan.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="64"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="65"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15851500988/in/set-72157649802065395" data-reactid="66"><img src="/assets/flickr/15/15851500988-tiny-f1a69dc56a.jpg" srcset="

I can tell you for certain, all those backpackers making claims about how there&#x27;s no point going to Roatan over Utila and that it&#x27;s just for rich tourists, are just regurgitating what others have told them because a) the diving is both a lot better and a lot lazier (longest boat ride was 10-15 minutes from the dock) and b) the prices are actually very similar to Utila. I think over the course of 10 dives it was less than $50 difference, although restaurants were admittedly more expensive (street food was cheap though!).</p><p data-reactid="83">My favourite dive was at a site called Texas. It&#x27;s a site off the tip of the island which almost always has a lot of current, although there was apparently abnormally little the day I got to dive it so apparently there was less marine life activity than usual but it was still amazing. Since there&#x27;s current you do the dive as a drift dive, where you get in at one place and let the current take you while the boat follows on the surface; it makes for extremely lazy diving.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="84"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="85"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419306323/in/set-72157649802065395" data-reactid="86"><img src="/assets/flickr/15/15419306323-tiny-28f92235ec.jpg" srcset="

The reef you&#x27;re drifting above is massive, trailing off for hundreds of meters in every direction, one direction sloping down until you couldn&#x27;t see anything but blue. We dropped down to about 25 metres, probably 2-3 metres above the reef, and floated along at a nice lazy pace for the duration of the dive, eventually popping up on the surface what must have been at least a kilometre from where we started.</p><p data-reactid="90">During the dive we saw loads of big stuff. Probably a dozen or more really big groupers, some turtles who cruised along with us for a while, a number of squid, and easily the biggest lionfish I&#x27;ve ever seen.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="91"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="92"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15419297383/in/set-72157649802065395" data-reactid="93"><img src="/assets/flickr/15/15419297383-tiny-8bf45ee2de.jpg" srcset="

I&#x27;m told that some of them are thousands of years old, and Jesus is one of the biggest ones. It&#x27;s opening would probably be about the size of your average household washing machine, the thing was enormous! Sadly, we found that a big chunk from the top of the sponge had very freshly been sliced by a fisherman&#x27;s line. It wont kill it, but it&#x27;s a shame that something thousands of years old can get damaged like that.</p><p data-reactid="97">Another notably unique dive was a site called the bear&#x27;s den, when you go down a dark tunnel into a rock (with a flashlight) which opens up into a cave with a &quot;skylight&quot;, big enough to have 5 divers in there at once. It really was the sort of cave you&#x27;d imagine a bear would live in, except it was some 25-30M underwater.</p><p data-reactid="98"></p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="99"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="100"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16038957555/in/set-72157649802065395" data-reactid="101"><img src="/assets/flickr/16/16038957555-tiny-2fba9d136d.jpg" srcset="

Total bottom time was 63 minutes, pretty amazing to have a dive where we had stuff to look at at both 41M and 3M, and be down there so long.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="111"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="112"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/15852911659/in/set-72157649802065395" data-reactid="113"><img src="/assets/flickr/15/15852911659-tiny-c60410876b.jpg" srcset="
