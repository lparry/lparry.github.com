Granada had been held by the Moors for quite a long period of time, which is why there&#x27;s a lot of Moorish style architecture around the city.</p><p data-reactid="44">One interesting thing I learn was about the trouble that UNESCO causes for the home owners in Granada who can&#x27;t afford to maintain their houses to the level that UNESCO requires. This lead to huge fines and eventually having to give up their houses to UNESCO. Apparently there is a huge proportion of abandoned properties in the old city caused by this. It&#x27;s troublesome to think about, you want these places looked after, but it seems cruel and wasteful to force the owners out because they can&#x27;t afford the maintenance.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="45"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="46"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13893651602/in/set-72157644104270734" data-reactid="47"><img src="/assets/flickr/13/13893651602-tiny-bbda2c5eab.jpg" srcset="

The table in the corner we initially sat down at turned out to double as a makeshift stage, so we shifted back a little to give the band some room. The place felt jam packed too, although Borja later told us it gets busier than that.  I don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;d fit the people.</p><p data-reactid="67">Just about everywhere in Granada does some form of tapas with your drinks. At this place they would ask you how many drinks you&#x27;d had each time you ordered another, and based on the number there was a certain sequence of little delicious snacks that you&#x27;d get to accompany your beverage.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="68"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="69"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/13916878053/in/set-72157644104270734" data-reactid="70"><img src="/assets/flickr/13/13916878053-tiny-db5fa8c827.jpg" srcset="

It was a small place down a little alleyway, off another alleyway with very utilitarian decor. Stainless steel benches, fixed stools and bain-maries full of food. It turned out to be a great choice, with really tasty food and the drinks were only â‚¬1.70!</p><p data-reactid="141">We got a message from Em and Connor and let them know where we were, so we could regroup and head the fountain, meeting place of the afternoon walking tour to the caves on the hill that we wanted to do.

We saw they offered snails as a non-tapas dish, so we ordered a serve to try them. What came out what a giant bowl full of snails, probably 40+ of them. I though they had a kind of odd texture and weren&#x27;t anything to write home about.

Unfortunately I think we must have gone to the wrong one (there seems to be two with the same name in Granada). We got a serve of regular sized prawns, shells and all :/ It was very noisy, all hard surfaces and no music or anything to help with that. It felt like being in a shopping centre food court except without the muzak. We decided to call it a night after that.</p><p data-reactid="265">My last day in Granada I went out to have a look at some of the clothing shops around the old city. There was lots of awesome hippy-style clothes, all of which would fit in at the Rainbow Serpent market but very little of which actually looked like designs I&#x27;d seen at Rainbow Serpent. I checked the tags on a few things and most of it seems to be made in Nepal. Seems like it would be a good place to go on a shopping trip.</p><p data-reactid="266">Leaving Granada I tried using a ride sharing website I&#x27;d just learnt about called Blablacar. I organised to get a lift to Cordoba, my next stop, with a guy who was living in Granada on the weekends and working in Cordoba during the week. He drove a fairly flash 2 door BMW, which was actually kind of cramped with 4 people in it, but all in all it was a good experience. Seems like the future of hitchhiking to me.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create','undefined','auto');</script></body></html>
