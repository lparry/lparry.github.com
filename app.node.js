I decided to try and push through that dislike and eat a salad every day until I either liked them or hated myself for doing it.  It actually didn't take all that long to get to the point where I almost enjoy them, I think the olive oil and lots of great feta and the freshness of the tomatoes definitely helped. I've continued trying to eat any tomato that has ended up on my plate even after leaving Greece (I was wondering if it was just the Greek tomatoes I was liking) and it seems to have worked somewhat.

From the first time I saw these on a video on Youtube I've been in awe, and then when I saw the $1500 price I was in even more awe. Getting to actually spin them was amazingly, fun and kind of disorienting (they're super bright), but also kind of terrifying. I'm sure they're probably pretty tough, but the though of having to pay for them if they got broken meant I was probably more worried spinning them than I've ever been with fire."

We got a taxi from the airport and my first impressions of Istanbul proper were that everything appeared so clean, modern and organised. The highways were multi-lane, there was nobody wandering out trying to sell things to passing traffic, traffic flowed very quickly and efficiently, people drove on the correct side of the road and actually stayed in their lanes for the most part.
